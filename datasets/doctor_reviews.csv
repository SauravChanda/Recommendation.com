Dr. Andreas Gomoll,Future and current patients beware. Dr. Gomoll performed a partial knee replacement on me. Had to have a full knee replacement after 17 month. The surgeon who performed my total knee stated the device was malaligned and he could see mechancial catching of my patella on the device Dr. Gomoll installed. Been in recovery for over three years.
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"I have been a patient of Dr. Gomoll for over 10 years and the only negative thing I have to say is that he is leaving MA to move to NY. He is a Doctor unlike any other I have had the chance to meet. Over the years I have spent countless hours talking about my knee with Dr. G and I don't have a bad thing to say. He is patient and kind, not to mention talented. He both takes the time to listen and explain things. I am sad to see him leave and NY is very lucky to have him."
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,14 months ago my daughter had surgery for a frayed miniscus. During the initial surgery her first surgeon found significantly more damage and had the foresight to stop and refer us to Dr. G. He met with us and suggested a course to allow my daughter to continue her athletics. He was positive and thorough. A year later she worked hard and has recovered well resuming all her activities. I highly recommend Dr. Gomoll
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"Dr. Gomoll is a true professional in every sense of the word. I call him my ""miracle doctor"" as he was able to find a spot for me in a trial study for my knee. Just amazing and I'm thankful to be under his care."
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"I can't say enough about this doctor. My daughter is 15 years old. She has had a rare condition called Osteochondritis Dissecans since she was approximately 8 years old. Over the years, she has gotten 3 lesions that needed treatment as she doesn't respond to conservative treatment. She had her most major surgery last July with Dr Gomoll. He did an osteochondral allograft, MPFL repair, and TTO. I cannot say enough about his care and technique. This has worked! My daughter has no pain now"
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"Rare combination of kind and competent. Listens well and takes the whole person into consideration when deciding on best course of action. Big believer in doing no harm and will exhaust other treatment options before surgery, this is a good thing! If surgery is necessary he is well versed in best practices, especially for biologic joint reconstruction. Cartilage procedures are his forte and he's keeping me active at 40 when other doctors would have just given up on my knee."
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"Cannot say enough great things about Dr. Gomoll and his practice. Never had issues with appointments, visits, surgeries, follow-ups, etc. As a doctor I felt he was very personable and actually seemed genuinely concerned about me as a patient."
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"My experience with Dr Gomoll has been extremely positive. He takes the time to clearly explain his diagnosis and discusses options objectively. I never felt rushed or ""just another patient"". After years of knee pain and countless time spent doing PT and receiving cortisone shots; I am pain free. My daily activity has increased and I am looking forward to exercising again"
Dr. David Levine,This physician refuses to speak to physicians when they want to refer patients. His staff gives you the run around and lies and says that they will have the doctor call their primary care doctor when he has no interest in doing so. He obviously only cares about the money and not patients.
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,Dr Gomoll put my knee back together almost 8 years ago. Without that procedure I certainly be contemplating a knee replacement. He seems to handle the worst of the worst. His OA Courtney is always very helpful. A very skilled surgeon.
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"Dr. Gomoll took a conservative approach to treating a torn meniscus. Ultimately, I needed to have a surgical procedure to address a meniscal tear; I am very please with the results. There was a lot of helpful communication and explanation from Dr. Gomoll and his staff before, during and after the procedure. Every question I had was thoughtfully and thoroughly answered."
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"very professional staff all around, really care about the patient's well-being, overall great experience"
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"Dr Gomoll performed ACI surgery on me in December 2014. The surgery went well and I have since returned to all of my activities. He followed up and was always friendly and professional. While I hope to not need another knee surgery, I would go back to Dr Gomoll, particularly if I need ACI on the other knee at some point"
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,He did a great job of explaining my options. The Conformis partial knee replacement surgery has gone well so far. Three weeks after surgery I have accomplished 120 degree range of bend. This is following the recommended PT exercise regimen. He called me the day after the surgery to see how I was doing. My home health team were highly impressed with the outcome with the Conformis knee and wound healing. I would recommend him wholeheartedly. Brigham Womens Faulkner Hospital rocks.
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"Dr Gomoll did a high-tibial osteotomy to relieve my severe knee pain. It's a surgery, I later found out, that most orthopedic surgeons today don't even know how to do. That surgery solved my problem and made it unnecessary to get a knee replacement. Dr Gomoll puts the patient first, he is not out to ""sell"" surgeries, he explains everything in plain English, and he's always upbeat and personable. He's the best!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,Dr.Stephen g. Silver performed surgery on my rotator cuff and saved my arm and shoulder. He did an excellent job and his staff and surgery associates were all wonderful. excellent surgeon.I would Highly recommend him to my family and friends!
Dr. Stephen Silver,Dr. Silver is very skilled and extremely professional I would highly recommend him to anyone
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr. Silver performed arthroscopic surgery on my left shoulder to reattach the labrum and a tendon, remove a bone spur and other repairs. The surgery went extremely well. Dr.Silver did a fantastic job. Now my left shoulder is free of pain and the range of mobility is like it was 20 years ago. I strongly recommend Dr. Silver to anyone that needs orthopedic surgery."
Dr. Stephen Silver,Great experience was very happy with my results it has been 7 weeks and I am already lifted weight lightly. Was very important to me to go back to my activity.Dr.Silver did what he said put me back together.Was in horrible pain for years if I knew it would be like this I would have had it done years ago.Staff was great . So satisfied I am waiting to do my left .Words can not explain how great he was .Thank you Dr. Silver.
Dr. Stephen Silver,Dr Silver operated on my shoulder and my knee. He is patient and caring and takes the time to explain things in plain English. He answered my questions and made me feel comfortable about both procedures. I had rotator cuff surgery on my shoulder and meniscus repair on my knee. My treatment was excellent and I highly recommend him
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr. Silver did an amazing job arthroscopically shaving off a large sharp hook shaped bone spur and repairing a fully torn rotator cuff, 2 torn muscles and a floating tendon .5 months ago. I had very little pain following surgery and had full range of motion within three months of surgery. I can even zip up a dress by myself! I'm currently working to rebuild strength and endurance, hoping to resume my full exercise routine including push-ups in a few more months."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Saw Dr. Silver for diagnosis of multiple shoulder issues. He suspected a labrum tear from my symptom and I received an MRI that confirmed it. Surgery booked within a month and 7 months later am thrilled with results. Wonderful surgeon with a great demeanor. Love Vivian, his office manager as well."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I highly recommend Dr. Silver for any patient with an AC Joint separation requiring surgery. Dr. Silver and his staff are professional, they make you comfortable, and they take pride in their work. If your healthcare coverage gives you the option, I strongly recommend going to the Vanguard Surgical Center in NJ where Dr. Silver operates. Their facility is state of the art and his surgery team was remarkable! Dr. Silver is the best in the business!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I tore the tendon in my shoulder a year ago and I was told by two Doctors that there is nothing they can do. I found Dr. Silver and he was able to make the repair which changed my life since I am an active individual. The day after the surgery, Dr. Silver called me to see how I was doing and gave me some recommendations on what I should be doing. Dr. Silver = Dr. Good News !! He also has an amazing staff that will ensure a smooth process"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I had a knee scope performed by Dr. Silver on 12/14/16 to remove meniscus tear. The procedure was quick, it was performed at a great surgical center in NJ, Vanguard. It has been less than 24 hours and I already removed the bandage. I have very little swelling and almost no pain in the knee. Dr. Silver and the staff at his facility were amazing!! I hope not to have any more knee surgeries, but if I need one, I will most definitely go back to Dr. Silver. Thank you sir for taking great care of me!!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I have had to have two surgeries over the past year,on my right biceps tendon (ruptured at the elbow) and my left rotator cuff (torn). Both surgeries were completely successful from my point of view. Right arm is fine and my left arm can reach over my head ,which may not sound like much, but from not being able to lift it all-it represents a steady climb to full mobility (surgery was 4 months ago). Dr. Silver is professional and I would recommend him to any of my family or friends."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I can't say enough great things about Dr Silver, his staff, the office, and everyone involved! Dr. Silver establishes rapport easily and made me feel comfortable and in great hands from my initial appointment! His office staff was amazing as far as handling scheduling of surgery and acquiring test results. My surgery was flawless and my recovery went great! One of my best medical decisions was to be placed in his care!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I have lived with shoulder pain for 15 years. And then I met Dr. Stephen G. Silver and scheduled surgery. My bicep tendon was shredded, had significant bone spurs, multi tears, arthritis etc. Amazingly I had zero pain following the surgery. The recovery has been relatively easy. I credit Dr. Silver for his meticulous work. He’s also warm, inviting and shows he cares. He is a master at his craft. I couldn’t recommend him and Vanguard Surgical Center more enthusiastically."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr. Silver is an excellent surgeon who I would highly recommend to those needing knee or shoulder surgery. Unfortunately, his receptionist, Esmyrna is extremely rude. She doesn't return calls and her follow-up is awful. I had to call her numerous times to get her to simply fax a form to my insurance company. She is abrasive and curt and clearly doesn't belong in a healthcare setting. Its unfortunate that such a nice doctor could have such an unpleasant person representing him and his practice"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I recently had a bone spur removed from my shoulder and repair on my rotator cuff. Dr. Silver did an excellent job in explaining the process and the benefits of the surgery. His staff is courteous and helpful. Had the surgery done in mid-April, and am currently in physical therapy."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr. El-Gazzar is an amazing physician/surgeon. I met him over 4 years ago when I had a broken leg and ankle. 2 years later he performed a partial meniscus replacement on my knee. He is kind, caring, confident and knowledgeable. He has done a knee meniscus replacement on my son and seen my daughter for knee issues. The process for all procedures and after care went smoothly because he took the time to explain everything before and after. I would highly recommend Dr. El-Gazzar."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,Dr El Gazzar is a very meticulous and caring doctor.... He is very in tune to making his patients understand what your treatment can and will incur.... His staff is very patient friendly.... Don't be intimated to ask questions.
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,was very pleased with the entire experience and would highly recommend Dr. Elgazzar
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr. Elgazzar is one of the best in the world! He Was in-depth knowledge about my torn PCL. Within ONE day, I had approval from insurance, MRI script faxed to radiologist, and an appointment the NEXT day! I highly recommend Dr. elgazzr you want the best!"
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr El-Gazzar is awesome, he is thoughtful and very caring. He is on point and give options talks to us like we are people. His staff is friendly, very helpful"
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr. El-Gazzar is the finest surgeon I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He took care of my son as a charity patient when he shattered his elbow. We were so lucky to have had him as Jesse's surgeon. He has a reputation for arrogance, but he has earned that right, because he's just that good. I unconditionally recommend him to your attention. I don't even care about the extended wait times to see him at the hospital... we were, after all, a charity case"
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,I highly recommend Doctor El-Gazzer to all my friends and families. He is passionate and committed to each patient and makes sure he provides the best possible care.
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"I've been to many doctors over past years and I can safely say that this is the first time I was compelled to write a review. The doctor himself is very busy but he takes the time to explain everything until you feel comfortable with your diagnosis. Also Dr Elgazzar is NOT ""let's rush surgery"", surgery was the last resort after we tried all other options. The office is very modern and clean and the staff were pleasant and professional. I recommend him highly."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Great Professional. Very intelligent, and trust worthy. Not part of the big Business field of medicine. Really is concern with my well being and gets me back on track."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,Best experience!
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,He was very patient and sat with me to discuss what was wrong. Great quality of care and hospitality.
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Please do yourself a favor never go and see Dr El-Gazzar. I was made to wait 120 minutes before his assistant come and took a stock at my problem. 6 mins that's what he took to document my years old problem. Then comes Dr El-Gazzar, a self proclaimed super busy guy, not in mood to understand patient needs and problem. He spent 2 mins, yeah that's right 2 MINS, and went away. Then comes his assistant back again and gave me prescription and left the room. That's it the appointment was over."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,Dr. El Gazzar is a wonderful dr. He us caring and his staff is wbderful. His wife Samia is hust as caring and takes time to talk and comfort pstients. I highly recommend this dr. Bernadette Berry
Dr. Howard Rose,"Dr. Rose is wonderful. I had rotator cuff surgery in 2015 and was amazed how great I felt day one. I heard so many horror stories about the surgery, but not with Dr. Rose, he is the best. I recently injured my knee and went to see Dr. Rose. Appt was easy to get with a pleasant staff member. Went back today for a follow up from my tests, that were just taken yesterday. Again the appt was easy to get and there was no wait, I never even sat, went right in. Talia was great as were all the staff."
Dr. Howard Rose,"I am three months post rotator cuff surgery. I am pain free and my arm is flexible. I can shoot hoops with my 7 year old grandson, open and close windows, carry packages and dress with ease. And, I haven’t even finished PT yet. I feel brand new again. A few years ago, I had a TKR with amazing results as well. Both times thanks to Dr. Rose. Aside from being a gifted orthopedic surgeon with the skill of a plastic surgeon. He is kind and caring. He gets the job done and done well! "
Dr. Howard Rose,"I was satisfied with Dr. Howard Rose, but as far as his staff and especially the billing department they are the worst I ever dealt with in any medical office. I went to see Dr. Rose for a knee injury, I saw him twice in 2 weeks. After about another 2 weeks, I got a call from the billing department telling me that they received a call from workers comp insurance company stating that my injury was now under review with workers comp and that Dr. Rose does not handle Worker comp insurance so I need"
Dr. Howard Rose,"have used Dr. Rose for all my orthopedic needs for many year. In my opinion, he is amazing. I have also referred several family members and friends who have had knee replacements performed by Dr. Rose, all with success."
Dr. Howard Rose,Dr Rose is ok. Nothing special. He did my total knee replacement 9 months ago. Been giving me problems the last 2. His office was not courteous all the time. Go somewhere else. You can do better.
Dr. Howard Rose,"Dr Rose is a good surgeon but his staff is so bad that I can't recommend him. They are unprofessional, rude, mean, insensitive. They are bullies. His nurse practitioner is a the most unhappy, nasty, disrespectful witch I have come across in a medical setting. I have said all of this to the doctor. I very strongly think he will do nothing about it. I am sure he already knows."
Dr. Howard Rose,"LI Office-Dr. Rose, talented & exceptionally gifted orthopedic surgeon; suggest he take a closer look at his office staff. Waiting for my mother provided several chances to observe how people are treated in the waiting room. First, look up & acknowledge when a patient is standing in front of you to check in; eye-contact would even be acceptable?. Staff is the first introduction to your office; should minimally be professionally & courteous. Observed too many times to be just an odd occurance."
Dr. Howard Rose,"DO NOT book an appointment with Dr. Rose. His medical skills are great, but his office staff (his family members) mistreat and denigrate their patients, make frequent mistakes, no customer service, dont return phone calls or emails, lie and may attack you. This happened to both me and my mom after being patients there for four years. This is absolutely the most incompetent and unprofessional practice I have ever experienced. I do not recommend him to anyone, seek competent care elsewhe"
Dr. Howard Rose,"Within 3 1/2 months I've had 2 meniscectomies performed by Dr Rose. He is a first rate physician & surgeon who is also kind, compassionate & patient. He takes the time to explain and answer all questions - his wonderful sense of humor a great asset!"
Dr. Howard Rose,The best. Did my hip surgery last week and he is just an amazing doctor. Great bedside manner.
Dr. Howard Rose,"Dr. Rose is a total professional.He explains everything in detail and is very easy to talk to. He performed total hip replacement on my right hip and within 5 weeks, I felt like new.He is an amazing surgeon who I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone."
Dr. Howard Rose,"Been a patient since 2010. I cannot begin to describe how fortunate I am to have found him. I am about to have my 3rd surgery with him. I would not even consider going anywhere else or using anyone different. There have been procedures, I've had, that were not in Dr Rose's scope. He made absolutely certain, that I got with the right Dr and followed up on everything. I don't know where he finds the time? He is unbelievably intelligent yet humble. Spends the time needed. Truly a gift from God."
Dr. Howard Rose,"He is the whole package? If I were to use professional sports as an analogy, not only would Dr. Rose be a leading scorer and all-star player in the big leagues - He'd be the captain of the championship team and the MVP.   He possesses all the qualities you want in a surgeon, especially when dealing with complex and ambiguous injuries. He's smart, knowledgeable, and has a great sense of humor. He is a great listener, and shows that he cares about you by never rushing though anything."
Dr. William Levine,From start to finish I had full confidence in Dr. Levine and his staff. My questions and concerns were answered and addressed. The recovery and post op kept me at ease. I'm confident that the quality of care is directly connected to my speed of recovery.
Dr. William Levine,I would absolutely recommend Dr. Levine to anyone that needs an orthopedic surgeon. I am so happy I decided to get surgery myself and the recovery has brought me back to 100% if not even a little better
Dr. William Levine,I would definitely recommend Dr. Levine to family and friends. Thanks for everything!
Dr. William Levine,Dr. Levine was a wonderful surgeon and I would highly recommend him
Dr. William Levine,I have had 2 surgeries with Dr. Levine. I can't say enough wonderful things about him and his staff. They all made me feel at ease and much less fearful. I would highly recommend Dr. Levine to all family and friends. Thank you so much for your great care during a difficult time.
Dr. William Levine,Thanks so much to Dr Levine & team for helping me recover from my recent shoulder injury. The support during the surgery and recovery were amazing. I can't say enough positive things about the Dr Levine and I'm looking forward to a full recovery. I would highly recommend Dr Levine & team to anyone ! Thanks again!
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine was amazing. He made what I thought was going to be a scary experience very calming. He always gave me choices and made sure the decision I made was completely mine, never forcing his opinion on me. He never let me get ahead of myself with recovery and kept bringing me down to earth. I truly can't thank him enough. My shoulder is feeling great and I am starting to resume all my normal activities. His demeanor completely put me at ease and am so greatful I found him!"
Dr. William Levine,"When I first came to Dr. Levine's office, moving my shoulder/arm was extremely painful. The pain was restricting my ability to do daily activities. Dr. Levin and his crew did a complete shoulder replacement. I expected to have a great deal of pain but it was minimal! Today, a year later, I have full functioning of my shoulder with NO pain. I am delighted, and I have recommended Dr. Levine and his team to several friends - the experience was optimal!!"
Dr. William Levine,"On my first visit with Dr. Levine he answered all my questions, I never felt rushed,he spent more time with me than the other two doctors I saw combined . I had a full shoulder replacement and the surgery was very successful , Dr. Levine made me feel very comfortable and I would highly recommend anyone having shoulder surgery to pay him a visit."
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. William Levine is the best.. I didn't know what to expect when I was told I needed a total reversed shoulder replacement.. Dr. Levine explained what would be done, made me very comfortable and without hesitation or a second opinion, I knew he was the doctor to perform my surgery.. I am thrilled with my results and would recommend Dr. Levine in a heartbeat.."
Dr. William Levine,"outstanding surgeon ,great pt.care and follow up."
Dr. William Levine,Fantastic - Both he and his staff!!!!
Dr. William Levine,"For my first major surgery (bankart labrum repair), I could not have had a better experience. Dr. Levine and his staff were responsive with appointments and able to answer any question I had regarding the surgery and/or post-op appointments. The facilities that Dr. Levine uses through Columbia Health are also top notch."
Dr. William Levine,Dr. Levine diagnosed and repaired my torn rotator cuff (reattached supraspinatus). Recovery is coming along as expected
Dr. William Levine,"Not only is Dr Levine an excellent surgeon, he is able to explain everything clearly at every step of the way. He set my expectations realistically and my entire experience from office visits to surgery was top notch. The office is one of the best run medical offices I have ever dealt with."
Dr. William Levine,"Very positive. Good result and generally pleasant interactions, especially during clinic visits. He was a bit curt in responding to some of my queries before the procedure on the day of the surgery (they were logistical, not medical, and had to do with when and where my wife should pick me up after the procedure -- he seemed annoyed by the question yet he was clearly very busy). Otherwise everything has been excellent and I would definitely return to him if I had a similar problem in the future."
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine was superb in not only explaining to myself and my family what exactly was wrong with me when no one else could, but also in totally fixing my knee and ensuring I could return to top shape."
Dr. William Levine,Dr Levine performed surgery on my left shoulder. It was a complete replacement. I have to say it has been a phenomenal experience with him. I feel great and have complete range of motion restored. His expertise and knowledge surpassed my expectations and his bed side manner is second to none. There is never a wait time to be seen at my appointments. I came to him for a second opinion and thank God that I chose him for surgery. I would recommend him to everyone I know

Dr. William Levine,"I simply can't thank Dr. Levine enough! His directness and courtesy considerably reduced my despair. His skill as a surgeon is reflected by the fact that my once dead left arm/shoulder (rotator cuff tear) now feels great! Frankly, it was an excellent experience in an otherwise awful time"
Dr. Todd Albert,"Great experience with Dr Albert. Able to quickly identify the issue, explain the options, and benefits & risks of surgery. Surgery was as expected. Great surgeon surrounded by an equally excellent supporting cast."
Dr. Todd Albert,Very nice Doctor. Very kind and knowledgeable. The best of the best
Dr. Todd Albert,"Dr Albert is the best doctor I've ever encountered he did what he said he was going to do I had two Surgeries cervical spine and also lower spine opening up stenosis, he has the best manners very compassionate and did what he said he was going to do the first time ever a doctor ever did that for me well worth the drive from Connecticut which is a pain in the a-- but would do it again in a heartbeat the best results ever the best doctor ever"

Dr. Robert Strauch,"Dr. Strauch was terrific. He took his time, explained everything in detail, patiently answered all my questions. His staff are friendly, caring and professional.

Dr. Robert Strauch,"when no other doctor wanted to take my case because it was too difficult, DR Robert Strauch came to my rescue . I injured my hand on a construction site fall of one story. I went to 4 different hand specialist and they all said it was beyond their expertise. Dr Robert Strauch was the one who took me in,explained the operation and condition of my hand.

Dr. Robert Strauch,I had carpal tunnel syndrome requiring surgery. I would routinely get awakened at night with severe pain in my hand.

He personally called me on Sunday the day before the operation to reassure me and make sure I had no questions. After surgery I had no pain and the hand pain at night was gone. I did not even need 1Tylenol. 1 month later there is virtually no scar. He and Columbia were great

Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"What can be said. As the saying goes “action speaks louder than words”. Taking an elbow that was shattered into 13 splintered like pieces, and making it whole and functional in a 14 week period speaks for itself!!!! Dr. Seigerman’s surgical skills speak loud and clear . . . “THE BEST” The Institute for Hand & Arm Surgery entire team (nurses, office manager, etc.) contribute to the healing process by treating you like a person not a patient.

Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"I had the misfortune of breaking my humerus bone and was rushed to the emergency room where I had the good luck of meeting Dr.Siegerman; the specialist on call for these types of emergencys. p As soon as he came into the room to talk to me I knew I was in good hands. He is an extremely thoughtful, smart and kind Doctor and I highly recommend him."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,It is difficult to say enough good things about the treatment I received from Dr Sigerman. The decisions were made through an honest and open discussion of the situation and the options available to best address it. I can safely say that it was his skill in the end that ultimately made the decision for surgery the success that it has been for me.
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"Great positive experience under Dr Seigermans care. Clearly explained the options to save my finger and insure the best possible use of my finger again. During the operation Dr Seigerman, who has great bedside manner, decided to insert a pin and cast it to insure no movement and a speedy recovery. Dr Seigerman top notch staff shows all the respect, courtesy, support and help through a difficult experience. Thank you for saving my thumb! Highly recommend."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"I was recommended to Dr. Seigerman in September 2016 when I broke my elbow. After a visit to Overlook Emergency room I was told to follow up with an orthopedist. I asked for a recommendation and they gave me Dr. Seigerman's name. I needed physical therapy and he also offers that service in his office, but I was given the option of going wherever I wanted to. In February I needed surgery on my left arm and Dr. Seigerman did it for me. He is a great doctor, with wonderful bedside manner"
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"Strange but true...I had injured my right wrist after a motorcycle class and was unable to play my classical piano music for stress relief. After having gone through emergency care I sought a professional for the lingering pain. Dr. Seigerman gave me two options for recovery and trusted him. We tried the non surgical then went the surgical route after the first option wasn't working. After the surgery the office has a therapy and cast making team. Fantastic experience, excellent and best Dr."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"Hey all, This is one professional individual with whom I strongly recommend a visit if you've got something ""off"" below the elbow.

Dr. Gary Starkman,"have been a patient of Dr. Starkman for a number of years. My life has changed from being constantly affected by my affliction to being free of it. Aside from having this practice run professionally and thoughtfully, his staff is also super helpful and accommodating. One of the best (definitely on the top of the list) neurological practices in NYC"
Dr. Gary Starkman,Really listen to my issues and was the doctor that helped me
Dr. Gary Starkman,I have been a patient of Dr Starkman for many years. He is probably one of the best doctors in his field. He helped me to get my life back. The office staff is friendly. Maggie is a sweetheart and takes care of even impossible requests. I can't believe some of the reviews. It is like we have been to 2 different offices and seen 2 different doctors. I know that Dr Starkman lost a very close person recently. We patients often forget that doctors are also human beings. Would recommend this doc 100%
Dr. Gary Starkman,"I was not at all happy with Dr Starkman ... To start the staff is rude and appear bothered when you arrive... After sitting in the waiting area for approximately two (2) HOURS; Dr. Starkman arrives disheveled with a look of confusion... When i start my consultation i did not feel as if his attention was solely on me.. He looked at his cell phone a couple of times, he accepted a call and i had to reminded him what we were discussing... I truly would not recommend this doctor"
Dr. Gary Starkman,Dr. Starkman's office does not honor their appointments and constantly cancels and changes them. After they messed up the appointments they tried to make me wait over another month to reschedule my appointment when they made the mistakes and didn't follow through with return phone calls. There apparently is a lack of concern for the patient making them wait another month because they messed up. Would not recommend going to this doctor.
Dr. Ilya Kister,"Dr. Kister is an experienced, empathic brilliant neurologist. His ability to assess symptoms and their combined effects on one’s life is impressive and speaks to his knowledge of often vague but profound symptoms as they affect someone’s life"
Dr. Ilya Kister,Dr Kister and his office failed me miserably. He misdiagnosed me with multiple sclerosis in 2011. He refused to do a spinal tap but had no problem treating me with toxic medication. I then begged for a spinal tap. I contacted his office even the office social worker and got no response at all. I then received a package from the office with all my records. I do not have multiple sclerosis. I have chronic Lyme's disease. I found out because I doctor did a spinal tap on me and tested me
Dr. Ilya Kister,Dr. Kister is an amazing professional that know so much about MS. I feel very confident that he will help me to find the balance I need to control my MS
Dr. Ilya Kister,Been with him about 10 years now and I think he great

She has deep specialty in MS and applies expertize in a very thorough and candid manner. With excellent patient manner, she respects patient decisions and supports their goals. If you have MS you need an expert partner for the long haul. Dr Gauthier is an excellent partner"
Dr. Susan Gauthier,It's hard enough to go through this but having Dr Gauthier at my side has made a world of difference. Couldn't pick a better doc
Dr. Susan Gauthier,"I live in Florida and feel blessed to have found Dr. G. I've been a patient for over 10 years! While it is not the most convenient situation for me, I find she is worth the visit. My experience has been all positive which include excellent communication, very responsive to emails/messages, very knowledgeable, current, and over all kindness and desire to help her patients. Very thorough with tests, too"
Dr. Susan Gauthier,I liked her until she told me I should take a trip to a hot climate because having MS should not stop me enjoying life. She knows absolutely nothing about the pains of having a MS to even say something like that. I wouldn't be able to go to any environment that above a certain temperature without having major flareups
Dr. Susan Gauthier,"This doctor is very corporate, goes straight to the point as far as putting you on the meds but doesn't check other aspects like your hormone levels etc. Doesn't develop a personal plan cater to your particular needs for example: doesn't give you a plan/guide that shows your progress, for better or worse aside from the medication & her follow ups are only during appointments. Considering the kind of field she's in, this Dr doesn't really show compassion or a sense of personal attention"
Dr. Susan Gauthier,The only aspect of having MS that is good is getting to be Dr. Gauthier's patient
Dr. Anna Kogan,"Excellent neurologist, very knowledgeable. Great bedside manner. Recommended"

Dr. Anna Kogan,She is extremely thorough and a great listener. Strong Recommend
Dr. Anna Kogan,After seeing the doctor she said she wanted to run some tests. I was then left waiting in a room for her to come back and do the tests. She still didn’t appear after an hour. In the end I had to leave and didn’t get my tests done. I found it so disrespectful and such a waste of my time as I will now have to find someone else and start all over
Dr. Anna Kogan,I felt rushed. She is not a good listener. I think she can be a bit warmer and more accommodating with her patients
Dr. Gerald Smallberg,He was a wonderful Dr. but is no longer practicing
Dr. Gerald Smallberg,Great clinician as well as caring and compassionate human being. They don't make them like this anymore
Dr. Risa Ravitz,"My first appointment was scheduled when the dr was at a conference and not in the office to see me. I was not told until I was at the appt.

The dr. filled a reduced rx and never called me or found time to see me to discuss a revised treatment plan or explain how I might feel being off the medication. horrible bedside manner. Will be finding a new neuro"
Dr. Risa Ravitz,"Greetings Dear Dr. Raviz. I have a 3 months history of pain in right leg.

Dr. Ruben Kuzniecky,"Dr Kuzniecky is the best specialist on epilepsy and all other neurological issues, and also the best all around doctor I have seen. He pays attention to all symptoms, and integrates his findings in focused recommendations, in the way that one expects the very best doctors to do and more so. Clearly he has the neurological problems along with the whole patient's case in mind. His examinations and medical directives are the most trustworthy and most significant of all the ones that I been given"

Dr. Alla Mesh,"I was repeatedly misdiagnosed for years. Dr. Mesh identified my problem as chronic migraines and advised treating it aggressively as it was not responding to daily medications. Botox injections gave me relief I had only ever dreamed about from what had become an excruciating existence. She is attentive, experienced, and explains things thoroughly and clearly"
Dr. Alla Mesh,"I made an appointment, and was running late from work. I tried to call to ask if I can come in late or reschedule, but my phone call didn’t go through due to poor service on the train. They denied me an appointment ever again. What kind of doctor denies a patient in need of care"
Dr. Karthikeyan Arcot,Dr. Arcot came to see my sister in the hospital and was WONDERFUL in helping her understand her condition better. He was incredibly helpful and compassionate. We recommend him highly
Dr. Karthikeyan Arcot,"Dr. Arcot truly cares about his patients and looks at the entire picture, including a patient's and family's needs. He quickly assesses and accurately determines a patient's condition in the most expert and professional manner. We saw Dr. Arcot during very trying times and he was a star for us"
Dr. Karthikeyan Arcot,"I saw Dr. Arcot in the ER at Lutheran Med Center. I was pregnant & disoriented; I also have a blood clotting issue & disorientation. My symptoms had a medical reason but twice Dr. Arcot suggested that I was distressed and exhibiting these symptoms because I needed more attention from my husband during pregnancy. I deeply regret that in my disoriented state I couldn't tell him off! Luckily my spouse calmly insisted this was not the case. A year later, still having billing problems w/ ofc"
Dr. Karthikeyan Arcot,Scheduling an appointment was horrible and confusing and the office wait for the appointment was terrible. It took 2 hours of waiting for a schedule appointment. Its a shame because he seems like a good doctor
Dr. Cary Buckner,Excellent. He listens before he asks questions. And he replies accordingly. I first me his as a stroke patient and have continued seeking and following his advice for six years
Dr. Elena Frid,"I can't say enough positive comments about Dr. Frid and her staff. She is brilliant! Most of all she treats my daughter as a person, not as a patient. She makes her feel special and I believe each patient Dr. Frid has is special to her. When your 13 year old spends months in bed sick and their "" pretty lady dr"" takes the time to respond to them on instagram and brings the biggest smile to their face, you can't put a price on that"
Dr. Elena Frid,"Be AWARE! that Dr Frid Is ONLY seeing NEW patients and will NOT see you again once you are a existing patient, and you will be referred to another Doctor in her office even if you request only to see Dr Frid .You will be told or at least I was told, she is only seeing new patients and that I had to see the other Doctor. I was very happy with Dr. Frid when I went to her last year, she helped me a lot with the issue I was having, she understood the problem and was very smart. I grew to trust her"
Dr. Daniel Barone,He discovered my sleep Apnea and i finally feel rested. The place where the sleep study was conducted is beautiful and very clean. I never wait as he keeps to schedule. I like how he looks at the results and duscusses them with me
Dr. Daniel Barone,Dr. Barone is a top physician. He is old school in the sense that he really cares for his patients. Warm and genuinely interested in your welfare. Hard to fine such fine care these days. I am delighted to have him as my doctor. Highest possible recommendation
Dr. Daniel Barone,"To put it simply, Dr Barone saved my life. I suffered with Restless Legs Syndrome for over 2 years before meeting this doctor and under his care I can confidently say that he has given me my life back. He is very thorough and kind and I can only hope that others that are suffering with RLS have the opportunity to see him. He saves lives"
Dr. Daniel Barone,"Dr. Barone was very flippant, arrogant, unprofessional and unhelpful. Didn’t return phone calls or emails. I wouldn’t recommend going to him"
Dr. Daniel Barone,"had a great experience with dr. barone, he was able to help me stabilize my sleeping cycle, allowing me to be much more productive at work and manage stress"
Dr. Klara Briskin,Where do I begin? I've been suffering with chronic pain due to my 3 spinal surgeries & left rotator cuff repaired for about 10 years. I been 2 several doctors who only cared about milking my insurance but NOT Dr. Briskin. Dr. Klara Briskin is not only a professional but she actually cares about her patients. Dr. Briskin will go to the extreme to render the best treatment possible & I trust my life in her hands. She has thus far been the best doctor I ever had. Thank You Dr. Briskin with Love
Dr. Klara Briskin," was treated by Dr. Briskin for several months and was extremely grateful for her compassion, knowledge and attentiveness. Dr. Briskin is a true professional. Not only do I feel much better, but I have also recommended her to my friends and family members who share my opinion"
Dr. Klara Briskin,Professional of the highest caliber. The doctor saw me even though I was not covered on the day of the visit. She took her time and heard meet out then scheduled me for all appropriate testing and correctly diagnosed my issue....I am so grateful to have found her. Many thanks
Dr. Klara Briskin,"It is a shame that a good doctor slips through my fingers because she doesn't take my insurance - but when the insurance was better was all to happy to treat me - funny thing though I confirmed twice with the insurance she was in the plan and the day before my visit the office calls and says she "" just"" got out of it --- I think they just didn't want to see me because of my plan wether they were still in or not which tells me I need to move on - if its all about the money I need to go"
Dr. Klara Briskin,I'm very disappointed with the way I was treated at Dr. Briskin's office. It was hard to get in touch with a doctor over the phone when I need it and more care about receiving the copay then treating a patient. She wasn't ready with all the paperwork at the time of my appointment which started 30 min later then it was scheduled. At the time of my appointment I was informed about broken office equipment and proposed to come on different day. Would not recommend this doctor to my family or friend
Dr. Howard Sander,"Dr Sander is a 5-star physician. He is thorough, he listens, he explains everything & he not only answers questions he usually answers them before you ask. He looks at the whole patient & the complete history. When you see him you have his undivided attention; no cell phone on the desk, no phone interruptions, no one knocking on the door to distract him. He is extremely knowledgeable & I am grateful to have found him. I now understand why he is booked 4 months in advance"
Dr. Dominique Cozien,I would recommend Dr. Cozien himself; He is an excellent diagnostician who really listens and has a passion for his work. The office can be a bit bumpy though. I have called twice to have a treatment plan re-sent to me but still haven't received it. The first one was misplaced as it was sent to me long after my follow up visit while I was away. I also received a bill for my follow up visit months late! The office is not very together but the doctor is great
Dr. Sylvia Mohen,very knowlegeable
Dr. Sylvia Mohen,I had tests done that day so that is why I was there a long time
Dr. Harold Weinberg,"Dr. Weinberg was thorough, kind, has excellent manner, and is extremely knowledgeable. He answered every question I had, I never felt rushed, overall a great visit. I will be bringing my family to him should the need arise"
Dr. Harold Weinberg,"Dr. Weinberg is a bad doctor! I have had 2 cancers, 8 surgeries, and am quite astute when it comes to the medical arena. This MD was excessively sarcastic and condescending. He called for a C-spine MRi and told me to call for the results. When I reached him, he offered nothing but ""you have a bad back ... lots of problems."" When I tried to get him to engage in some detail as to what was found on the MRI, he would not. A waste of time. I advise going elsewhere. I learned nothing, gained nothing"
Dr. Steven Karceski,"I wish that all my doctors were as compassionate, kind and respectful as Dr. Karceski. It is my blessing that I found him. I can't say enough. He is not patronizing which means a lot to me"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Dr. Rosenthal's office accommodated quick appointment turnarounds. Dr. Rosenthal himself is friendly, kind, informative and to the point. He makes you feel at ease despite the diagnosis, positive or negative. Highly recommended specialist"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"I was really nervous when I arrived, but I was relieved to find the doctor to be understanding, knowledgeable, sympathetic, and he was on time for my visit. He asked tons of questions and was very thorough. I felt very comfortable with him and am so happy that I found him. The staff was really organize and caring. I was very satisfied with my visit and highly recommend this doctor"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"I find it hard to believe that any of the positive reviews are true. This doctor is rude, and his level of knowledge is less than any other medical professional I have had. I would never recommend him and if you are using him I highly recommend trying someone else. He runs his office like a failing business desperate to grab every dollar he can. He does not have a bedside manner unless you liked to be talked down to about your own body and health. He is a terrible doctor"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Thorough and not overly reactive. I've gone in with numerous ""small"" complaints - a neurologist is almost a primary care physician, in that he can diagnose and treat all sorts of ailments. Very attentive and responsive. I've recommended him to many friends, all of whom are pleased"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,I found Dr. Rosenthal on Zocdoc and went in for a consultation for numbness in my hand. He determined through very extensive testing that I'd had a mild stroke--something my primary doctor missed--and started me on the correct course of treatment ASAP. He even contacted my primary to discuss the oversight. His office manager Nicole stayed late to book me an emergency MRI and on one occasion helped me to get a test done when Dr. Rosenthal's office was closed. These people listen and they care
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Every patient arrives with different needs. The unique nature of each visit tends to create reviews so specific that they offer little guidance, good or bad. Dr. Rosenthal, however, has mastered those exceptional qualities universally desired by all in need of help. He is Sympathetic, Intelligent, and Effective; inspiring confidence that problems can be treated and better days will come. Nicole, who does everything the Doctor doesn't, is a friendly voice and a great help"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"I have been a patient of Dr. Rosenthal for many years. He is a warm caring very competent physician who was recommended to me by a retired surgeon. Several years ago I had severe back problems and Dr. Rosenthal arranged for me to immediately see a neurosurgeon at Weill Cornell. Two days later I was operated upon and two months later I was playing tennis again. The office is small with his very competent assistant, Nicole, handling the administrative tasks. Dr. Rosenthal works on a timely basis"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"I first met Dr. Rosenthal in December 2012 for my diabetic neuropathy. I found his initial evaluation and assessment to be very helpful and insightful. I have continued to see him for my neuropathy ever since. Either on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, depending upon how the neuropathy in my feet and lower legs is progressing. His office administrator has been very helpful with insurance, making appointments and reminding me when my next appointment is. I strongly endorse his medical services"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"After suffering from cluster headaches for years, Dr. Rosenthal diagnosed and treated them effectively. He called me back within an hour on more than one occasion when I had questions about my treatment. He is extremely intelligent, dedicated, and professional. I enthusiastically recommend him"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"I was referred to Dr. Rosenthal for a tremor. He ordered an ultrasound of my carotid arteries. The right carotid artery was over 90% blocked. I was stunned. High cholesterol runs in my family. Had an endarterectomy, blockage removed, carotids clean. Saved my life. Brilliant diagnostician, thorough, listens, inquisitive, caring. With tremor I'm unable to take the drugs usually prescribed. Trying a drug which is in the testing phase for tremor, specifically my voice. I'm a singer, actress"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"I have been seeing Dr. Rosenthal for as long as I remember (maybe 10 years now?), and I have recommended him to anyone who suffers with migraines. He is helpful, inquisitive, responsive (I once had an emergency on the weekend in the summer -- he called me back quickly), and he is warm. He also is v empathetic to the nonsense that goes on w/ insurers. What I really like about the office is that it is very small. It's usually just Dr R and Nicole, who runs the front end. After years of going ther"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Dr. Rosenthal and staff are friendly, thorough and professional. I've been seen him for years and it's always a painless and pleasant office visit"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"I would highly recommend Dr. Rosenthal. He was extremely thorough, very smart and took the time to answer all of my questions. I also have to say that making an appt and dealing with insurance with his office manager Nicole was super easy and pleasant"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Dr. Rosenthal is a terrific doctor, who takes time and care with his patients. He is a fount of knowledge and information, with a warmth, depth, and sense of humor rarely found in doctors in my experience. He treated me for a problem I was suffering from for a long time, and patiently worked me through my diagnosis and treatment until the symptoms were almost completely gone. I couldn't be more grateful to Dr. Rosenthal and his assistant Nicole who is also very charming. Thank you Dr"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Dr. Rosenthal treated my father-in-law, my mother and me. Firstly, he discovered a problem in my f-i-l that no one else could diagnose. He personally made the phone call to a surgeon and continually followed up on his progress. He saved his life . Secondly, he appropriately diagnosed my mother's problem, referred her to the appropriate surgeon and again continued to follow up on her care. The same was true for me. He diagnosed my problem and provided me the medication that solved my issue"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Not only he rushes you but doesn't listen to all your symptoms. Clearly just wants the money,thats it.The front desk girl so rude, my god, wouldn't answer, put me twice on hold and when she picked up the 3rd time she hung up. Pointless worker clearly. NEVER AGAIN"
Dr. Neil Rosenthal,"Dr. Rosenthal is a thorough doctor who listens, prescribed multiple tests, and analyzes to find out what are the reasons for my blackouts and near fainting spells. I felt confident under his care. He is busy but has good bedside manners"
Dr. Jennifer Langsdorf,"Excellent diagnostician, spent a full 30 minutes on initial visit. Horrible bedside manner would probably be better suited doing full time research in a lab than having human interaction with patients"
Dr. Jennifer Langsdorf,"I have been a patient of Dr. Langsdorf for 8 years. Caring, professional, knowledgeable, yes. Would recommend her highly"
Dr. Jennifer Langsdorf,I would not recommend this doctor to ANYONE. She is cold and does not have the people skills required to form a relationship between a patient and a doctor. She does not follow up on what she says she will do either. She also does not properly explain things to a patient in a way that they can understand and are satisfied
Dr. Jennifer Langsdorf,Dr. Langsdorf was very thorough and very nice. She listened attentively and answered all my questions. Highly recommend her
Dr. Dana Leifer,"I was recently referred to Dr Leifer and my wife went with me to his office at Cornell.Dr.Leifer was excellent;and I was impressed with his great knowledge,the thorough exam he performed,his great patience,the care he took including the amount of time I was with him which exceeded my expectations.He requested important tests,my blood work was completed that day in the lab downstairs,and my radiology testing was performed immediately the next morning.I highly recommend this excellent caring Dr"
Dr. Dana Leifer,"The worst. Rude. Obnoxious. Workmanlike. I feel sorry for anyone in Leifer's care. He simply does not give a blank about his patients. Either Leifer is plodding away while keeping patients waiting, eating while keeping patients waiting, on the phone while keeping patients waiting or seeing patients with an attitude like it's the last thing he wants to be doing. An educated jerk"
Dr. Dana Leifer,"Perhaps one of the worst physicians I have ever dealt with. He is almost ambivalent when it comes trying to address my husband's medical condition, he has no suggestions or a treatment plan to try to make forward progress. To make matters even worse you have to wait over an hour for every appointment and trying to get him to refill your prescriptions is near impossible without 3 to 4 phone calls/messages"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,I got an inj for my back over 5 years ago and felt amazing until I threw my back out playing golf last week and got my second injection and feel 95 percent better already. Thank u
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"Lovely doctor. Couldn’t have been happier with my visits. This doctor truly changed my life and gave me hope and my life back. After my injury, I thought I wouldn’t be able to do anything ever again but I was able to go to college and get a job and it’s all bc of dr s!! Thank you"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,he actually cares about your pain and you as a person and listens to your complaints instead of blowing them off. truly best doctor in town
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"“0” Stars. Does the office staff reflect the physician? I had my first visit to Dr. Schottenstein on 4/4. 1 of the 2 presrcriptions needed Dr. preorthorization. I left a message for 3 consecutive days. None was returned. Traveled from Staten lsland to Lenox Hill Radiology 4/10 in Bay Ridge for scheduled MRI & X-ray . Told to be there 9:45. Left home 9AM. Received call LHR at home 9:20. Message...”doctor never authorized tests; called office, no one answered (surprise!).Reschedule.” Unbelievable"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"My mother experienced a terrible herniated disk recently. I found Dr. Schottenstein and since he was conveniently located near my office and my mother's apartment building, I decided to give him a try. His staff made my mother and I feel like a priority from the first phone call. Dr. Schottenstein fit us into his busy schedule the very next day which was important for us as the pain was excruciating for my mother and needed medical attention ASAP"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,Best doctor out there
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,This is the only pain doctor anyone should ever go to. He is the best I am telling you and he knows what he is doing
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,wonderful and very knowledgeable. He is a great doctor with great bedside manner. It was a pleasure seeing him and having him treat my condition
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"i seriously can't believe how great i feel. probably i have 99% relief from the pain i had had for 4 years. fantastic experience at the office, and dr. schott is a wonderful guy"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,great guy
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"Horrible human and doctor. I had an appointment. Waited over an hour then was put in a room. After another 45 minutes spoke with a PS who took my information. He came back 5 minutes later and said, sorry, he can't prescribe the medication you are on. I asked if I could see the doctor. After waiting again, more time passed and was told to go to someone else and gave me the name of a clinic that couldn't help"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,Great doctor and excellent staff - always a pleasure to go therefore
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,i couldnt be happier with dr schottenstein and his staff the office is so nice and kind and dr schottenstein is very intelligent and compassionate
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,I have seen many doctors both in NJ and NYC for excruciating back pain. I finally found a doctor that tames my pain.   It took few visits to treat neck mid back and low back but he was able to numb it .  Dr. Schottenstein can do an epidural with one hand tight behind his back with his eyes closed because he is that good ! ! ! Anyone complains about many injections he does I guess they have not experienced the agony of a back pain. His experience and efficiency is greatly appreciated by me
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"After initial appointment, you are seen by an assistant, not an MD, who evaluates all tests and recommends treatment. I was advised to get various injections based on conclusions other MDs strongly disputed. Dr. does NOT tell say you will NOT see him after initial consultation. The waiting room is packed, there is a long wait, but, unless it's your first visit, or an injection: everyone is seen by a team of PAs. Great business model for Dr., but unacceptable patient care"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,Great guy! Awesome doc
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,I am a Chiropractor in NYC and I have a terrible back. Dr. Doug did a procedure on my called RF and it made me nearly pain free for five years. Absolutely amazing. I send my difficult to treat patients to his facility
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"I was in Severe back pain caused by spinal stenosis. Dr. Schottenstein and his staff were able to relieve the pain. I am pain free, without medication. Thanks Dr. Schottenstein and staff"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,I'm so grateful to dr Schottenstein and his Amazing staff
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,have had chronic pain for over 10 years and this pain has consumed my daily life. i had given up the idea of my pain every going into remission and had given up many things in life and lost my once active lifestyle. i used to be a compettive triathlon athlete and having to go from that to someone who cant walk more than 10 minutes without being in excruciating pain is very hard to say the least. in the past several years i have seen several doctors and none compare to dr chottenstein
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"I called the office for an appointment and told them I was going on vacation soon and they made sure to get me in beforehand which I am extremely grateful for. They are even open on most holidays! Dr. Schottenstein himself is a great doctor who is knowledgeable, compassionate and truly cares for his patient's well being. He didn't pressure me into anything and discussed in detail with me my options for my back/knee pain. His assistants were especially helpful and I felt taken care of every step"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,highly recommend dr schottenstein he is the most caring empathetic patient courteous doctor i have ever met they always make you feel like you're VIP and they always take the time to answer all my questions needs and concerns
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"i have never met a nicer, more knowledgeable, and down to earth doctor. he makes jokes and makes you feel very comfortable during procedures and hwne talking to him. he never makes you feel stupid and his staff is very knowledgeable as well. i really enjoyed my time with dr schottenstein and will definitely beb ack"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,Excellent staff and Doctor. Dr Schottenstein runs a tight ship and accepts and is in network with almost all insurances which is rare to find in the city. Very happy with my care
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,i went to see dr schottenstein for pain and osteoarthritis in my knees and low back pain. i was an avid runner but the pain and stiffness just became too much and had to stop running. I cannot say enough about Dr. Schottenstein and his extremely professional and caring staff. He followed up with phone calls weekly to see what my progress was and i'm back to running again and couldn't be happier. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend dr schottenstein to anyone
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,i have had chronic pain for over 10 years and this pain has consumed my daily life. i had given up the idea of my pain every going into remission and had given up many things in life and lost my once active lifestyle. i used to be a compettive triathlon athlete and having to go from that to someone who cant walk more than 10 minutes without being in excruciating pain is very hard to say the least. in the past several years i have seen several doctors and none compare to dr chottenstein
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,"Top notch I've been dealing with rude staff at doctor's offices my whole life, and this was the first time I felt really comfortable. The office manager personally greeted me when I was escorted to the exam room and there was little wait considering how busy the office was. Dr.Schottenstein is a must see for anyone in pain"
Dr. Douglas Schottenstein,Dr. Schottenstein and his staff are immensely compassionate and exceptionally attentive. I had lived with chronic and excruciating pain for years until I found this practice - Dr. S's approach is both complete and encouraging. This practice truly goes above and beyond for their patients and I place 100% confidence in their care
Dr. Susan Broner,Dr: Broner is an excellent; thorough doctor who will work very hard to help you. She spends a great deal of time with her patients & is extremely knowledgeable
Dr. Susan Broner,"Dr. Broner is extremely attentive, spent over an hour with me in the examining room and talking through my symptoms. I've been to dozens of doctors and they never give you more than 15 minutes of their time. The entire staff was punctual and friendly, I didn't wait more than a minute from the time I checked in to the time Dr. Broner called me in. The only negative was that it took months to get my appointment"
Dr. Susan Broner,The Dr has terrible [nonexistent] bedside manners. Always late. Considering her mediocre training & pedigree she sure has a lot of attitude. Her staff is rude/ incompetent. They've flubbed every appt i've had on the scheduling side & then they give u major attitude in person. Highly avoidable
Dr. Susan Broner,"Excellent doctor and nice facilities, however she is always running behind schedule and you often have to wait 30+ minutes after your appt time before you're seen by the doctor. Additionally it is difficult to schedule urgent appointments. Often there is no availability for close to two months. When you are experiencing a horrible migraine it does not seem advisable to wait that long before seeing a doctor"
Dr. Susan Broner,"I have been seeing Dr. Broner for about 7 years for migraines and she is absolutely excellent. I trust her completely, she is empathetic while being clear and decisive, listens impeccably and always has my best interests at heart. She sets the standard for a specialist physician"
Dr. Michael Lin,"I've had several concussions, am over 60 years old and prior to seeing Dr, Lin had been to several doctors who were unable to determine and fully explain the cause of my symptoms. Doctor Lin was the only one . He responded to my many questions with detailed answers and was extremely patient"
Dr. Nancy Nealon,"Dr. Nealon is an outstanding physician. I simply do not understand why her ratings are not higher here. She is extremely smart, knowledgeable, caring, empathetic, extremely responsive, on top of all the very latest research (much of which she and the hospital participate in), flexible, open to a range of therapeutic approaches, patient and gentle. I am so glad I was referred to her, and could not ask for a better MD to help me navigate and treat MS. I saw other MDs, but I am sticking with her"
Dr. Nancy Nealon,"Very knowledgeable and friendly, will recommend without reservation"
Dr. Nancy Nealon,"If there was a million stars to highlight she would get them all. Dr.Nealon saved my life. If your looking for a doctor who will do everything and anything she can for you, dr. Nealon is the one! I was admitted into Weil Cornell hospital and that's where I met Dr.Nealon and saw how she was there for me so I had to stay with her. I live on Long Island and travel into the city once a month to get my medication and see her everytime I I'm there. She will lead you in the right direction"
Dr. Fabio Iwamoto,"We recently had our first visit with Dr. Iwamoto. Although I cannot judge his professional knowledge, he did spend enough time with us, telling us about issue, the treatment. He also spent enough time answering our questions and addressing our concerns. He is frank but not blunt. We are thankful that we met him"
Dr. Fabio Iwamoto,"Dr Iwamoto is an outstanding physician and all round human being. He balances the need to provide reassurance and practice evidence-based medicine, with a rare ability to seek out new treatments that sometimes require an element of risk. He respects the people he treats and doesn't pretend to have all the answers. I believe I am fortunate to have him treating me"
Dr. Fabio Iwamoto,Dr. Fabio Iwamoto is attentive to his patients needs. He is very intune to the entire betterment of the person. He cares listens and learns about the persons family needs as well as what will be best for his patient. He always puts his patients first. He also recognizes that his patients family members also have information to share. He is careful and unrushed. He may have a lobby full of patients but makes you feel that you are the only one. I have never had such a wonderful doctor in my family
Dr. Fabio Iwamoto,"Excellent doctor, very caring and very knowledgeable in his field. Provided best healthcare for my husband"
Dr. Fabio Iwamoto,The miracle physician
Dr. Sang Lee,Dr. Lee is a very competent doctor and grateful to avoid a bowel resection. During the office visit prior to surgery everything went smoothly but a breakdown after surgery and going home. Dr. Lee did not once come to examine me and had to beg for one of his staff to explain what transpired during the surgery. The hospital nursing staff was great at Keck Hospital but there was a lack of follow through in explaining present and next steps. Was disappointed in efforts to involve patient in care
Dr. Sang Lee,"One of the best doctors I've encountered! Saw him after being severely ill with crohns, he immediately took action and performed surgery.. met Debbie and Dianne who made me feel comfortable with what was soon to be the new normal. Dr. Lee not only gave me back my life but saved my Jpouch... profesional, humble, bright, innovative and caring... thank you Dr. Lee and team( surgical and office staff"
Dr. Sang Lee,"He was my moms dr in NYC. She ended up with colon cancer. They type of surgery she did, he went thru her belly button. No scar and no pain!! She was a nervous wreck. She has never been to doctors before nor surgery! She even made my dad sleep in the hospital with her. The bottom line is that she is now cancer free. We are sorry he left NYC. he has amazing bedside manners..great person, amazing dr"
Dr. Sang Lee,"Dr. Lee was my physician for the last 5 years until he left NYC. What a loss for me. Actually, given how excellent he was in ALL ways, I will do my check-ups with him when I have occasion to visit Southern Cal. Other doctors in the NYP/Weill Cornell Med Center, although of course good, seemed much more concerned with making you spend many thousands of $ as the primary goal. Dr. Lee was considerate and did only what seemed necessary. He has MY loyalty, - always. Dr. Gregory Scott "
Dr. Sang Lee,"The best doctor and the excellent surgeon, He repaired my rectal problems that other clinics couldn't fix it quite right, but Dr Lee treated with 2- 3 times of surgeries.Since then I am getting better almost every year from the first year and now...I am great! Thanks, Doctor Lee, you are the one can be called the great SURGEON"
Dr. Paresh Shah,I was recommend by my Gastrologist Dr. Gross at NYU. Best recommendation ever made. I met Dr Shah in 2016 very mannerable and kind. After all my test were completed he recommened a Parotidectomy. I thank God for Dr. Shah he is very kind and will not perform any unnecessary procedures. He always considers what's best for his patients. I was admitted to the hospital early one morning for Splenic Infarctions. Dr Shah came late that evening to see how I was feeling. Would recommend anytime
Dr. Paresh Shah,"Our family is fortunate to have found Dr.Shah. Dr Shah and his staff are beyond amazing. Our dad had an excellent care. He always went above and beyond providing care for our dad. He is very humble,warm,compassionate ,a good communicator and has a great bedside manner. We strongly recommend him to anyone looking for a surgery"
Dr. Paresh Shah,"You can not measure the level of care and compassion Dr.Shah extends to his patients You will find no greater physician . I literally owe my life to him . I can never put into words his kindness, knowledge or expertise . I am fortunate to have found Dr.Shah . Gifted surgeon and dedicated to his work yet still maintains a respect level with his staff and hospital workers that may only be surpassed by his patients level of respect . I have only high praise for Dr.Shah"
Dr. Paresh Shah,"I whole heartily agree with the previous two comments . It's difficult in my vocabulary to find other superlatives to describe his excellence as a physician and talented surgeon. Brilliant but humble, warm, compassionate, a good communicator and a great bed side manner. He performed the same laparoscopic resection of the colon on my wife. After the surgery he came out with a smile and a thumps up. Above all he is a gentlemen . His team all love him as a leader an mentor. You're in good hands"
Dr. Paresh Shah,"Dr. Shah exemplifies what every physician should be. Extremely intelligent, warm, compassionate, great bedside manner. We highly recommend him. He performed laprascopic resection of colon on my husband. Therefore no need for temporary cholostomy. We are very thankful for his expertise!"
Dr. Paresh Shah,Billing department scammed me. I only have Bad feelings about this experience after this surgery
Dr. Paresh Shah,Best surgeon In Town was there everyday after surgery to check on me and make sure I was ok I would highly recommend her for anyone looking for a bariatric surgery
Dr. Paresh Shah,"Dr Kurian is excellent in her field of practice.She take her time to explain all of your options with you,while making you feel relaxed and comfortable. I highly recommend her to anyone who is struggling with there weight situation. Speaking not just as a patient but as a surgical technician who has assist her in a few operations, she is 110% professional and demand nothing less than excellence from those assisting her to provide patient care."
Dr. Paresh Shah,"Can't say enough great things about her. She rocks. You will absolutely adore her and her bedside manor is awesome. More so, she was given a gift with her skillful hands and knowledge that is second to none. How fortunate to have had her do my surgery. She becomes more than your caring and compassionate doctor. She becomes part of your family. Someone you can really to talk and not be judged for your faults. Thank you Dr. Marina Kurian for all you have done and all you continue to do"
Dr. Justin Steele,Dr. Steele was very professional and caring. I would high recommend him. Thanks again Dr. Steele...Huseyin Varna
Dr. Justin Steele,Very professional. Never rushed the appt. answered all questions
Dr. Justin Steele,"There aren't enough words to express our thanks to Dr. Steele for his skills and care of my husband. Another surgeon had done an emergency surgery on my husband and created an ostomy, which in turn created a triple hernia situation.. Needless to say, my husband's health and general life were severely affected. It took two surgeons to give my husband back quality of life and health. Dr. Steele took care of the hernia's and another surgeon took care of the ostomy. We 100% recommend Dr. Steele"
Dr. Justin Steele,"An unexpected, rapid case of appendicitis led me to the ER, where I eventually met Dr. Steele, who performed an appendectomy. He and his team were amazing: informing me throughout each stage of treatment, managing my pain and ultimately performing a successful surgery. Post-surgery follow-up visit with Dr. Steele was an equally informative, pleasant experience."
Dr. Justin Steele,"Dr. Steele removed my gallbladder a little over a month ago. He was amazing from my first consultation to the post surgery appointment. He is personable, funny and very professional. I never expected a surgeon to take the time to answer all my questions. Dr. Steele never pushed surgery on me, he advised me on how better I would feel when I no longer had gallstones. Dr. Steele is the best doctor I have encountered in NYC. Since having the surgery I feel 100 times better! Thank you "
Dr. Justin Steele,Dr. Steele was wonderful. He has a terrific sense of humor and he is a calming presence. The people he works with are also terrific! I was a terrified patient and he made me feel at ease! I would highly recommend him to anyone who has to face surgery Drucilla Cornell
Dr. Justin Steele,It is hard to find enough superlatives to describe the care I received from Dr. Steele and his staff during my recent hernia treatment and subsequent surgery. From the minute I met Dr. Steel it was evident that he was extremely competent and caring. He laid out the treatment procedures and told me what I could expect. The team that ushered me through the surgery and recovery could not have been nicer or more caring. Thank you so much for taking such loving care of me. I am grateful! FP
Dr. Justin Steele,"Dr. Steele a supremely competent physician. His manner is friendly, inquisitive and thoughtful. He is not in the least bit condescending and yet able to explain in clear simple terms what he thinks needs to be done and how it will be performed."
Dr. Justin Steele,Dr Steele was thorough and observant in his treatment for my condition. He made me feel at ease for my first surgery. The entire process was flawless from initial diagnosis to follow up.
Dr. Justin Steele,"I recently had a inguinal hernia repair, (bilateral), and it was accomplished by way of laparoscopic surgery using mesh. It was my very first surgery and I was subconsciously nervous, even though I did my best to act matter of fact and routine about it. I'm a former medical student, who changed careers many years ago to come to NY and pursue the arts, so knowing more about a lot of this, made it worse for me, when it should have made it better. Dr. Steele was simply the best!! ALL AROUND BEST!"
Dr. Justin Steele,"Dr. Steele performed a very complicated and critical surgery on my dad who at 84, was limited with surgical options in New Jersey. Dr. Steele and his team came up with a unique approach that has now provided him with added longevity and quality of life. From start to finish outstanding experience."
Dr. Justin Steele,Great surgeon to deal with. Made me feel comfortable the entire process. I had no doubt I was going to be ok. Checked on me after the operation and just always was honest about what was going on. You could tell that he had 100 percent assurance that nothing would go wrong. Sitting in the office waiting for my follow up I even recommended to someone else in the waiting room that Dr. Steele is the man to see. I hope I don't need any more surgeries but if I do I know who to call
Dr. Justin Steele,"Dr. Steele provided the best doctor-patient experience that I've had in my lifetime. This guy is not only professional, but extremely personable. Dr. Steele was incredibly adept at explaining what would happen and how I would be affected by my procedure, and made me feel very comfortable throughout the entire process as a result"
Dr. Justin Steele,"I was very pleased with Dr. Steele from the first appt. He did not rush to get me to the table. He made sure with other additional testing that my procedure was necessary for my condition. I had been suffering from chronic Acid Reflux for years. now, a Hiatial Hernia was making my condition worse and causing new symptoms. Afraid of further consequences, I seeked out Dr.Steele's aid. I am currently post op 5 weeks, just had my Upper GI done this week and NO MORE REFLUX!!! I highly recommend him."
Dr. Justin Steele,"I had hernia surgery as an outpatient on November 9, 2016 and my outcome has been excellent. My problem appears to be corrected with remarkably little discomfort or downtime.

I would, (and already have - my son needs minor surgery ), recommend Dr. Steele to anyone needing surgery."
Dr. Justin Steele,"I was referred to Dr. Steele for gallbladder removal, and when I had my first appointment I was in severe pain. I was so relieved when he told me I would have surgery the next day. He explained everything and made me feel at ease. He really cares for his patients. He called me back the same day when I had a question about an incision after the surgery (even though it was not an emergency). He also took the time to fill out my FMLA paperwork right then and there at my follow up appointment"
Dr. Justin Steele,Dr Steele was an amazing doctor. Took his time to explain to myself what was wrong and what needed to be done to take care of my issue. Dr Steele and his staff were all very helpful with any questions or concerns I had. Would definitely recommend Dr Steele to my family and friends and if needed would go back immediately for any issue
Dr. Justin Steele,"I have nothing but good things to say about my hernia operation performed by Dr. Steele. All the steps leading up the operation were planned carefully by his assistants. The operation itself was painless. The care provided by him and the hospital staff - before, during and after the operation - was exceptional. My full recovery is taking some time, but I have been assured by Dr. Steele that the operation was a success, and I would soon be back to normal"

Dr. Richard Whelan,"I had the special blessing of working at Downstate Hospital with Dr. R. Whelan for over two years, & later as a patient. He is very conservative with how he conducts himself with his patients. First with diet, exercise, & further testing ( if needed.) He is easy to talk to, listens well to patients, & is excellent as a surgeon"
Dr. Richard Whelan,"He performed only half a colonoscopy. When asked why, he responded that We ran out of tube. A joke? I do not know. Funny? Absolutely not. He never spoke to me again.

I would never subject myself to his treatment again"
Dr. Richard Whelan,"Knowledgeable, compassionate and accessible. His staff both in the office as well as the hospital are outstanding. While hospitalized, Dr Whelan visited me at least twice daily.

Dr. Pokala Kiran,Excellent caring doctor and phenomenal surgeon. Great staff. Was able to help me when I developed multiple complications after previous surgeries
Dr. Pokala Kiran,"My first experience with Dr. Pokala Kiran was surely my last. Going in for Colon & Rectal Surgery is an already embarrassing and overwhelming experience. Dr. Kiran was determined to make it, not only an increasingly embarrassing assessment, but managed to make me more confused after. He continued to talk down to me, treated me less than, and refused to spend time and answer my questions. At one point he said ""That's a question for your PCP."" My advice is go find a doctor with more compassion"
Dr. M Shane Dawson,"As the husband of a surgeon I am lucky to have insider knowledge as to how talented Dr. Dawson really is. He is the guy that doctors send their families to.

Dr. M Shane Dawson,"I had laparoscopic surgery: bilateral inguinal hernia repair with a mesh. Very thoughtful and caring doctor. Takes time to explain things. You don’t feel like he is rushing you through the system to get to the next patient. Surgery went really well on the Friday and I was back at on Monday. Could not be more satisfied. Only downside was he was not in my network (Oxford insurance), but it was worth the out of network expense"
Dr. M Shane Dawson,"Dr. Dawson is a magnificent physician. I experienced complete professionalism, skill and compassion under his care.

Dr. Yuri Novitsky,"Dr. Novitsky and his team were incredible. His attention to my particular problem and willingness to discuss options and procedures with me was incredible.

Dr. Novitsky and his staff went above and beyond in providing excellent care to me at all times"
Dr. Yuri Novitsky,"Dr. Novitsky is the best Ventral Hernia Surgeon in the Cleveland, Ohio area. He is superbly qualified, kind, compassionate and thorough. I am told my surgery was 7+ hours long. Imagine the ability of this surgeon in a marathon event, to afford me the fabulous result and my life"

He is wonderful and because of his expertise I am able to live a full life without having to worry about my hernia ever again
Dr. Yuri Novitsky,"Dr. Novitsky is a very caring professional who made me feel very much at ease with his knowledge and demeanor. I appreciated that when I first went to him regarding my inguinal hernia, he indicated that it was too small for surgery at that point and that I should wait. When it was time for surgery for that hernia and another one that developed on the other side, the procedure went very well and I healed fully without any complications. He answered all of my questions both before and after the"

Dr. Yuri Novitsky,"Professional, Knowledgeable, Experienced"
Dr. Melissa Pilewskie,"Dr. Pilewski was wonderful, both as a surgeon and as a person. She provided me multiple options but also respected my final choice not to have reconstruction.

The work she did, the care she took--I strongly recommend her"

Jonathan Baker, the PA is an exceptionally good healthcare provider. I never had any post operative complications and a last minute appointment or change is always granted"
Dr. David Greuner,"Dr. Greuner is a smart, compassionate, effective, fantastic doctor. I have been going to various doctors for years trying to understand what was causing such a variety of painful, uncomfortable, strange symptoms. Diagnosed with a very large fibroid, my GYN recommended an ineffective treatment plan. Luckily, a little google-fu led me to Dr. Greuner, who 1) identified a secondary condition caused by the fibroid and 2) addressed both problems quickly. It feels like a miracle! He listens, he cares"
Dr. David Greuner,"WARNING. David Greuner operated on my leg for varicose veins. After he performed a phlebectomy, my leg swelled up, turned red, and became very hot. It was very painful to walk. When I returned for a follow up, Greuner gave me antibiotics and told me my leg would improve in time. My leg continued to get worse. I went to the NYU Vein Center. They performed an ultrasound and found the cause of my injury. Greuner had cut and left an open vein in my leg"
Dr. David Greuner,"Kudos to Dr. Greuner, lovely Joelle, and staff for creating an outstanding as well as caring environment.

He and his whole staff are compassionate and full of personality. I love this man and am so grateful for his artistic talent"
Dr. Evan Matros,Dr. Matros is an artist in breast reconstruction. I was so paranoid because first the tissue expanders where horrible. They moved and were very hard. And then seeing pictures on line of mastectomy/reconstructed breasts was not easy finding good results pictures. Dr. Matros assured me they will be what I wanted and a natural feel. And he delivered. He also is sensitive to what you are going through as well. Which is important. Highly recommend!!!!!! Thank you Dr Matros
Dr. Evan Matros,"Amazingly talented, caring"

Dr. Evan Matros,"Dr Matros is a fantastic doctor. He performed three surgeries to reconstruct my breasts after a double mastectomy. I was a bit skeptical after our initial consultation as he's not the most warm and fuzzy doctor and wants to make sure your expectations are realistic. However, he won me over after surgery. He does amazing work (opinion of several oncologists) and also doesn't place unnecessary restrictions after surgery, which made a world of difference in my recovery. I'm forever grateful"
Dr. Evan Matros,"The most caring knowledgeable talented doctor. He has listened to us with attentiveness and genuine care.

Dr. Evan Matros,"I had the tissue flap reconstruction on both breasts in 2015. Dr. Matros spent 12 hours on my surgery, and nobody could have done a better job than he did!

Dr. Richard Lazzaro,"Dr. Lazzaro is a ,wonderful surgeon. His robotic surgery leaves you in minor, almost non-existent pain and results in a very quick recovery. There is no need to look further than Dr. Lazzaro. You're not going to find better than him in skill and kindness"
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,"I was diagnosed with Thymoma. My primary highly recommended Dr. Lazzaro, for consultation. From my first visit I felt at ease.

I have been given a new lease on life. Thanks Dr. Lazzaro"
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,"Doctor Lazzarro has saved my life. I had lung cancer and a tumor on my spine. I just had surgery on June 14, 2016. He is the most caring , compassionate person. He truly cares about his patients. Always visiting his patients very early in the morning before he begins his other surgeries and when he's done , Dr. Lazzarro does his rounds again to visit his patients in the hospital. I truly admire him . He's a very dedicated doctor, I wouldn't trade him for any other surgeon"
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,Dr L is extremely rude and condescending to his patient and employees. I highly recommend going to Mount Sinai for ct surgery
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,"i had a third of my lung removed filled with cancer.Dr Lazzaro is the best within one day iwas up and about,very little pain"
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,"I had the laparoscopic, robotic-assisted repair of para-esophageal hiatal hernia with partial Nissen fundoplication by Dr. Lazzaro in October 2016. I found Dr. Lazzaro to be a very caring and compassionate as well as highly skilled surgeon. I was actually terrified before this surgery, although I thought I did a pretty good job of hiding it from everyone! Dr. Lazzaro answered all my questions before the surgery, I did very well, and he and his staff handled my follow-up issues promptly"
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,The best surgeon there is. He is an amazing doctor
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,I was referred to Dr. Lazzaro by my gastroenterologist and I am so thankful to have met him. I recently had hiatal hernia surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital with Dr. Lazzaro as my surgeon. I would highly recommend him as he is absolutely the best of the best
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,There is simply no better Doctor or human being than Doctor Lazzaro. My dad was struggling with health issues for years and Doctor Lazzaro was instrumental in helping him get the care and guidance he needed.

Dr. Richard Lazzaro,Dr. Lazzaro is nothing short of a miracle worker. He treated my daughter like she was family. He made us feel extremely comfortable with not the most comfortable diagnosis to get. We were in his office and admitted the same day..operated on and finally my daughter was able to breath again!! Can't thank him enough for changing my daughters life
Dr. Richard Lazzaro,"An amazingly skilled doctor with an awesome, caring personality. He's the BEST"
Dr. Peter Geller,"Thorough, he took the time to explain the diagnosis, options, and answer all questions"
Dr. Peter Geller,"If you are a woman and you believe you have an occult hernia, do not waste your time with this man. Not only does he lack the knowledge to treat you, but he has zero compassion, which he makes up for with plenty of arrogance and willful ignorance. (I brought him the latest studies, and he refused to read them or even keep them to read later.) Maybe try the general surgeons at Mount Sinai, or the women's hernia doctor in LA"
Dr. Peter Geller,"An update: I got my MRI results back (from another doc) and, contrary to Geller's opinion, I do have a hernia. I don't mind that Geller made a gross error in his diagnosis as much as I am concerned about what he said: The search for the source of pelvic pain in women is often fruitless. He did not order imaging, nor did he conduct a proper clinical exam. And he covered up his own lack of knowledge about his purported expertise by trying to disempower me. Ladies, avoid this guy at all costs"
Dr. Peter Geller,"Dr. Geller was very sincere and knowledgeable. I did not have to wait long to be seen and in addition, his office staff was friendly and efficient"

Sinai hosptal for inrelated problems but when I see Dr. Martz on the hospital floor, I see him not just as a physician but as a friend"
Dr. Valery Dronsky,Dr. Dronsky was a very knowledgeable and highly talented surgeon. He completed the procedure in a timely fashion and his team of assistants made sure that I was treated with the utmost attention in the recovery room.

He was thoughtful, truthful, and extremely caring from the first moment I met him in the hospital to the several follow-ups in the weeks after my surgery. The whole office staff feeds off the positive energy as well. Thank you all"

Dr. Nolan Karp,"Dr. Nolan Karp is an excellent surgeon who is compassionate and cares about his patients. He performed a flap breast reconstruction on me and did an excellent job. He and his physician's assistant Brooke took the time to explain the procedure, and answer all my questions, and make me feel at ease before and after surgery. He has a great beside manner and is always smiling. He even takes the time to call his patients the day before surgery to check on you. All of his staff do a great job"
Dr. Nolan Karp,Dr Nolan preformed my breast reduction surgery the end of October 2017 I Couldn’t Have Found A Better Surgeon. Dr Nolan has a gentle caring manner. He has wonderful support in his office. They were always available for my questions or concerns. Dr. Nolan is the best

Dr. Karp was a good surgeon and reconstructed my breast like the old one. All through out my healing, I had no pain......... His staff totally made me feel at home thru the process"
Dr. Nolan Karp,"Dr. Karp performed my breast reduction October 20, 2017. I recently had my final post op appointment, and I can honestly say this surgery has changed my life. I went from 34I to approximately 34D/DD. My scars have healed splendidly, and all of my physical ailments associated with my large breasts have all but disappeared (back/shoulder/neck pain, rashes and scarring from bras, headaches). Dr. Karp and his staff are topnotch, and made this experience seamless and stress-free. I have zero regrets"
Dr. Stephanie Bernik,"I started out with Dr Bernik at St Vincent’s Hospital and followed her to Lennox Hill Hospital. She performed all 3 of my lumpectomies, preserved as much breast tissue as she could and you can barely see the scars (seriously). She is kind, compassionate, understanding and her patient care and bedside manner is beyond excellent. Thank you Dr Bernik"
Dr. Stephanie Bernik,"She’s amazing, extremely cautious, and so knowledgeable"
Dr. Stephanie Bernik,The staff in this office and hospital is incompetent. You will be very frustrated communicating with this office
Dr. Stephanie Bernik,"I definitely recommend Dr. Bernik as your breast surgeon. She is very knowledgeable, skilled, progressive and compassionate. She performed a lumpectomy with mammoplasty on both breasts, and used a biodegradable implant called BioZorb. The surgery was a breeze. Despite the amount of tissue removed, my breasts look so similar to pre-surgery! I'm cancer-free now and I'm thankful she made my DCIS treatment go so smooth. Another plus is she teams up with an amazing plastic surgeon (Dr Dec). A team"
Dr. Stephanie Bernik,"Dr Bernik is an excellent professional, skillful surgeon and just a great human being. I had extensive surgery, Dr Bernik was there every step of the way. Dedication and love"
Dr. Stephanie Bernik,"I was a patient of Dr. Bernik when she was at St. Vincents Comprehensive Cancer center. She helped save my life!

Dr. Zachary Gleit,"Dr. Gliet repaired 3 abdominal hernias I had developed due to previous abdominal surgeries. In my opinion, he is the best and I would recommend him to anyone needing hernia surgery. He pays attention to his patients, and spends plenty of time explaining the surgery, the expected outcome, and answering questions. I consider myself lucky that I found him"
Dr. Zachary Gleit,"Extremely knowledgeable, professional and quick service. Dr. Gleit repaired my hernia in less than two hours. I woke up, then went home. Next morning, I felt great, much better than I expected"
Dr. Zachary Gleit,"Having Dr. Gleit for my inguinal hernia repair was definitely a right choice. He is a highly professional physician, and his staff is well trained"
Dr. Zachary Gleit,"Dr. Gleit is a great doctor: very professional, with excellent surgical skills, very knowledgeable , and great bedside manner. He repaired my bilateral inguinal hernia. The incisions are small and the pain has been minimal during recovery. He is also very patient. He answered all my questions before and after surgery. I would highly recommend dr. Gleit"
Dr. Zachary Gleit,"Dr. Gleit is very professional. I went to see him for an incisional hernia. During the consultation, he apologized for making us wait and then thoroughly reviewed my medical history and did a physical. At the end, he patiently responded to all of my husband's and my questions. He didn't push us to do the surgery but recommended what was best. He was responsive when I called his office to ask a question. He is professional and patient with great surgical skills and excellent bedside manner"
Dr. Zachary Gleit,"Dr. Gleit repaired a very large, long-standing inguinal hernia. Every aspect of the care he and his staff at NYP provided was outstanding from the initial visit onward. His expertise extends to many other surgical areas. I recommend him most highly"

In our initial consultation, Dr. Gleit was friendly and, importantly, very patient with all of the questions that I had around the potential procedure. The actual procedure went very smoothly, I was able to speak with Dr. Gleit directly before and after. Further, Dr. Gleit called to follow up on how I was doing the next day. Overall, I would highly recommend Dr. Gleit"
Dr. Zachary Gleit,"Dr Gleit is a real pro: intelligent, courteous, human, and non-nonsense. He did my recent surgery and I had complete trust in him. When I went for my consult, he took me EARLY (!), and at the surgery he apologized for the later slot they gave me. He accommodated my need to have the procedure done in 2015 (due to high insurance deductible) and I am very grateful. He checked up on me in the recovery room and called me the next day. A + service."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Dr Greisberg listens and explains carefully. He is terrific and his team is too
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Dr. Greisberg is an excellent orthopedic physician who has truly helped me to recover from my injuries. He is patient and understanding
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg was excellent through all stages of the process. He identified all of my options and did not push surgery over non-surgical options. I chose surgery, and he was excellent - I have healed quickly. Dr. Greisberg was spot on in alerting me to how I would feel each day, week, and then each month during my recovery. I strongly recommend him to anybody"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Knowledgeable, caring, and detailed in surgical procedures, assessment, and rehabilitation"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Thorough and realistic with my recovery time/process. Excellent surgeon
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"This doctor is more concerned about ""consensus"" with other doctors than helping patients. I brought in an MRI, the report read I had ""at least a high grade posterior tibial tendon tear"" and he wouldn't even open the MRI. I believe he only wants very easy cases at this point in his career. Very sad"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"He is very professional. He communicates in a gentle. slow easy to understand language and tone. He's very polite and respectful. He listens and resolves my concerns. He was able to get me back on my feet and doing the things a mother of 3 does in five months. My husband and I are very impress with his knowledge, techniques, bedside manners, and professionalism. Thank you so much"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Very knowledgeable doctor, but spends about 5 minutes with you. You feel rushed and the front office staff that check you in are as friendly as a wet mop. So not worth it"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"excellent ""bed side manner"" and explanation of the entire process"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg and his staff are very knowledgeable, efficient and compassionate. I highly recommend Dr. Greisberg and his team"

Dr. Justin Greisberg,"About Dr. Greisberg and my Achilles' tendon repair: Thoughtful and insightful with regard to after surgery care and recovery. Pain free post surgery which I gather is rare. He calibrated his directions to me in line with my age, lifestyle and goals. Finally, he's very fit himself which makes sense when looking for orthopedic care"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Dr. Greisberg is an excellent knowledgeable surgeon. He always was very patient in answering my questions. Highly recommended
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"I dreaded a foot operation and had been putting in off for years. Dr Griesberg and his staff made the whole process so smooth, comfortable and anxiety free. He went through the process in great detail and I knew what to expect every step of the way. He is also a really nice guy"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,excellent caring competent doctor
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg is an excellent knowledgeable surgeon. He operated on the torn tendon in my ankle and the results were great. During the whole surgery and recovery experience, Dr. Greisberg explained to me exactly what I would be experiencing and he was 100% correct. He never rushed me out of his examining room during my office visits. . He explained and listened and now a days that is very rare!! I highly recommend Dr. Greisberg! He's a great doctor and his staff was wonderful too"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg is one of those rare doctors who make you feel better as soon as they come into the room. He's been as good as he could possibly be for me, today and in the past"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Dr. Gresberg is a great Dr. My foot is feeling much better. It was a long prosee but he did a great job
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg was recommended to me by a friend who been operated on by him and was very happy with proposed surgery and results. I am tremendously happy with how everything has gone with my tendon repair and follow-up as well. I have been able to resume my normal activities as expected, and I believe the treatment which was not always the same opinion I had received from other doctors was the right one"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"he is a great doctor. i had gone thru a process that i have never being experience before. he helped me get back on track after the lisfranc injury (surgery / screws removal) i been feeling great. i read some reviews after the post removal, some people has been gone thru worse but with Doctor Greisberg, i didnt experience any pain whatsoever. its being great"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"My experience with Dr Greisberg was excellent. I would recommend him without reservation, both for his surgical skill and the clarity of his explanations"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,This is the 2nd time Dr. Greisberg has treated me for a torn achiles. I have found him knowledgeable and sensitive to my concerns. He shares his analysis and reasons for treatment in an open manner. I would highly recommend him
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"I fell down stairs and broke my ankle in three places. After spending a night at a trauma center I was transferred to be treated by Dr. Greisberg and his team. My ankle was reset properly and I received superior care. My surgery was a challenge and four months later I am walking unassisted and back in a gym. I am grateful to Dr. Geisberg for his professionalism, accessibility, care and surgical skill. This team is with out a doubt the best in the city"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,If only I could put more stars I would! Dr Greisberg is such an outstanding and caring Doctor; he surpassed all our expectations! His expertise and level of care are unique! He was so caring about my well being before during and after my surgery. He listens and accommodated to all my needs. And the results: thanks G-od outstanding! Everyone is impressed by the results and my physical therapist told me in his 35 years career he never saw such a well done surgery
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Dr. Greisberg is amazing. He performed surgery on my ankle and it is stronger than ever. I no longer have the pain and discomfort that I previously experienced. I would definitely recommend Dr. Greisberg to others
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"The best! I only wish he had operated on my foot in 2003, instead of the surgeon I used. I recommend him constantly"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Words cannot describe how grateful I am to Dr. Greisberg for his fantastic job on my toes. He performed the surgery in March 2017, and my recovery post-surgery has been outstanding, with incredibly minimal pain. I also appreciated the deep care I received from Dr. Greisberg during my subsequent visits. I am extremely happy with the results on my toes. Thank you, Dr. Greisberg, for enabling me to walk again without any pain. I was so fortunate to be your patient! You're an Exceptional Surgeon"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Ughhh! Arrogant, self-absorbed, cold. Turn off. Regardless of alleged skill"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"I had a great experience with Dr. Greisberg. He stepped in midway through my Achilles tendon recovery; first surgery had been done somewhere else and gotten infected. Dr. Greisberg did the 2nd surgery and was super for the entire journey: working with the infectious disease doctor, seeing me through (and doing!) the 2nd surgery; and overseeing my recovery and rehab. He was straightforward, clear and friendly the entire way. I hope to never see him again ;) but he's who I'd pick for anyone else"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"I've not had a better experience with a surgeon. Dr. Greisberg knows his stuff and knew how to get me out of the pain I was in. He is optimistic about outcomes, LISTENS well and has had answers to all of my questions. And he is courteous. The surgical experience was organized and went extremely well. Even the decision about the kind of anesthesiology that was used during my surgery was explained in detail to me. The nursing staff and surgical coordinator were quite helpful"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Went to him as a second opinion after there was growth under my toenail. He is very knowledgeable and cared about my needs. He helped save my senior track season and preformed a minor surgery on my toe/toenail at the beginning of summer. When complications would arise, he always found a solution. Very efficient and gets to the point"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"He barely looked at my x-rays of my bunion. I guess because I wasn't a surgery candidate he didn't want to waste much time with me helping me with pain management. I found him to be rushing, matter of fact, and even said his foot looks better than mine (ah duh you never wore heels in your life). I felt like I was dismissed when I was expecting more solutions than just Advil or Alieve and comfy shoes. Maybe he's a good surgeon, but compassion and help with pain management isn't his strong suit"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Unfortunately Dr. Gresiberg's poor communication skills very much got in the way of treatment. He might be an excellent surgeon, but when asked questions he continually talked over me and ignored my questions and concerns. It made it incredibly hard to trust him with my care and after two visits I switched doctors only to discover that in his not listening, there were a number of things he had missed in his diagnosis"
Dr. Sherwin Parikh,"You are etter off going to a clnic than this office. The staff are completely inexperienced. The staff that deals with scheduling and patients are very rude, specifically the office manager Mike and Leah at the front desk. They will treat you like cattle and have absolutely no respect for your time or your condition. They triple book the patients too. The refused to see me because of a scheduling error on their end even though I tracleed from across town and took half the day off"
Dr. Sherwin Parikh,"I've gone to Dr. Parikh a few times and each times it's getting worse. This practice is more concerned about making money than providing health care. The front desk staff is rude and all they care is that you have a credit card on file..no credit card...no seeing the doctor. When Dr. Parikh shows up you can get whiplash by how fast he comes in and out. His concern is trying to burn something off so he can bill the insurance company..he tried to burn off a scratch saying it looked ""angry"""
Dr. Sherwin Parikh,"Dr. Parikh is a very knowlegable, kind doctor who explains procedures and diagnosis well. I have been going to him for over 10 years and wouldn't want to see anyone else. I highly recommend him"
Dr. Sherwin Parikh,Explained procedures well and took time to figure out the right approach for my particular skin issues
Dr. Julia Tzu,"DO NOT accept a referral to see this doctor for tests. My dermatologist sent me there for a skin biopsy. She only accepts ""certain insurance plans"" (including mine), but when I arrived for my appointment, I was told the doctor requires patients to keep a credit card ""on file."" Again, I was there for a medical procedure, am fully insured and was totally prepared for any co-pay. When I refused to provide a credit card, the doctor refused to see me. Despicable"
Dr. Lyubov Avshalumova,"Thankfully, Dr. A has an office located near my home &, since I have extremely light skin, this makes it convenient to schedule cancer screening appointments. Dr A carefully monitors potentially harmful growths & when necessary takes action to freeze, biopsy or remove them. She did flawlessly remove a cancerous growth from my nose and the scar is barely visible. I have no reservation recommending Dr. A to anyone seeking high qualiiity, diligent skin care. Many of my neighbors also see Dr. A"
Dr. Lyubov Avshalumova,Have only great things to say about Dr.A. She helped me with my acne. She was recommended to me by primary and I happy with her services. Would definitely keep her as my dermatologist
Dr. Lyubov Avshalumova,"Wonderful experience! Upon arrival I was greeted by friendly, pleasant staff. Within 10 minutes after filling out paperwork I was escorted to the room. Doctor came right after and examined my skin very carefully. She was courteous, professional, with very good bedside manner and knowledge. She patiently answered all my questions and removed couple of moles for me. Couple days later she called me with results and I was impressed by her promptness. I recommended her to my friends and family"
Dr. Lyubov Avshalumova,"I had a horrible experience with Dr. Avshalumova. She performed a skin biopsy on my face and cut way too deep, despite reassuring me that this would be a simple, superficial procedure with no residual scarring. More than 16 months later, I've spent a great deal of time and money on consultations with other doctors to fix the depressed scar that she left on my face--and I've been told that even with months of laser/microneedling treatment, I probably won't be able to fully fix the damage done"

Dr. Hennessey cleared up my acne in my 20's, diagnosed melanoma on my chest in my 30's (I have a family history of skin cancer, my maternal Grandmother died of melanoma).

Dr. Zoe Veritas,"I am a new patient to this practice and my experience has been very positive. With a history of skin cancer (7 surgeries to date), Dr. Veritas put me at ease addressing my ansgt when she had to biopsy two new moles. She addressed my questions and concerns. I also found the staff to be nice and accommodating when my scheduling my appointments. Thanks to Liza and Jasmine when doing my PDT! Dr. Veritas has gained my trust and I will continue with this practice"
Dr. Susan Katz,I've finally found a great dermatologist and one who doesn't want to treat me with injections or botox. Dr. Katz is a TRUE medical dermatologist. She is extremely thorough and a pleasure to work with. She answered all my questions and took the time to explain to me WHY the medical procedures I had been doing were not working (basically I had been misdiagnosed for over 30 years). I am so very happy that I've finally found a great derm. Thank you Dr. Katz
Dr. Susan Katz,Dr Katz has helped me manage my psoriasis for 5 years after taking over for other MDs in her group. She is highly skilled with my disease and the treatment options and has helped me immensely. She manages a large group of psoriasis patients and I value the breadth of her experience
Dr. Susan Katz,"Dr. Katz was my dermatologist for 18 years. She does a thorough exam and asks a lot of questions. After I moved to a different state, I have not yet been able to find a dermatologist that exhibits her level of care"
Dr. Susan Katz,Thorough and thoughtful
Dr. Susan Katz,"Would not take us because we showed up 15 minutes late, even after being informed that we had traveled for 2 hours for the appointment"
Dr. Adam Geyer,"I use Dr. Geyer as my regular dermatologist and for fillers and lasers. Ive gotten both Beletero for hollows under my eyes and Juvederm for the lines running from nose to mouth. He is really gentle and doesn't overdo it. Calm, cautious. I'm 63 and I definitely look a good ten years younger than when I walked in. It's expensive but if you go to someone who offers a discount or isn't an actual doctor, you will be sorry"
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,Excellent knowledge base. Had a great experience and would recommend her to others
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,"Terrible service, expensive solutions. The moment it became apparent that I wasn't going to drop $250 on products they sell per recommendation of the Dr the receptionist became very rude and dismissive. In addition, Dr Moulton Levy prescribed a topical treatment that, after multiple calls to the nurse, took them two days to call through to a pharmacy and then it turned out that it too cost hundreds to purchase, even with excellent insurance. Scam. Never going back"
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,The doctor herself is great and thoughtful. Her staff (office manager specifically) was incredibly rude and hostile to my over the phone. I missed my appointment due to a last minute meeting and tried calling the office to reschedule but no one answered my call. The office manager was unnecessarily rude after I simply told her I tried calling that morning and charged me a $75 no show fee
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,"I had an overall outstanding experience starting with the level of kindness and professionalism at reception. Dr. Moulton-Levy is also wonderful, every knowledgeable and a great communicator. highly recommend"
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,"The doctor did not read any of the paperwork I filled out prior to entering the room to see me, she was curt. I asked several questions to try to get treatment form her -- she did not treat me as a new first time patient but someone she just wanted to get out of her office. The remedies she recommended were basic and not new to me, and her office staff was incredibly rude and kept me waiting for 45 minutes, treated me like a dollar sign and not a patient, and made things more complicated. Avoid"
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,Excellent clinician
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,Great dermatologist
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,"OUTSTANDING. Dr.Moulton-Levy gave me all the time I needed to address all my concerns in a professional and thorough manner.

Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,Very Happy with her office
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,Great clinic and amazing experience!!!!
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,She is simply the best doctor I have seen
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,Outstanding amount of cosmetic options available and the doctor took time to go over those to help me make a best decision for my particular concern. Loved her and am switching to her for my medial needs as well. Such an attentive and caring doctor. I highly recommend
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,Dr. Moulton-Levy is knowledgeable and truly cares about her patients. I was extremely happy with the cosmetic services I received from her. I highly recommend!
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,"The doctor is lovely and has a great bedside manner. It's her staff that make the process a miserable experience - in particular the front desk staff at the Soho location are aggressive and verbally abusive. Even though the doctor is excellent, dealing with the other staff is not worth it. I now see another dermatologist who is excellent and her staff are professional and courteous"
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,"I've been seeing this doctor for a while now and have nothing but the best to say about her professionalism and level of knowledge. She really listened to my concerns in full which you don't come across often. Great bedside manners, comfortable with both, western medicine and a more holistic approach, and did not push any unnecessary procedures on me. I recommended her to several of my friends and they all love her too. A++"
Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy,I would not recommend to anyone. She sat at the furthest corner of the room and examine my shin. Then she recommend taking Zyrtec for it and doesn't even bother with a second glance. She has to be one of the worst doctor that I encounter throughout the years and seriously have some professionalism and do your job.
Dr. Sanjosh Singh,The doctor and the team there are awesome. Thank you so much
Dr. Sanjosh Singh,Terrible bedside manner. If you have a serious issue I would recommend seeing someone who actually takes time to listen and answer questions. She gave very vague answers and was very condescending in tone and expression. Ugh
Dr. Sanjosh Singh,Dr. Singh listened to my concerns and discovered that my child was on the wrong dose of medication. He wasn’t getting better from common ring worm for months and had seen 3 different practitioners. The pediatrician ordered the wrong dose(lower than what he needed) and everyone missed the error until I took him to her
Dr. Sanjosh Singh,She was thorough and knowledgeable
Dr. Sanjosh Singh,"Very professional and attentive, though appointments have felt a bit rushed."
Dr. Alan Greenspan,"I've been with Dr. Greenspan fo over 10 years, and have recommended a number of friends to his practice. Professional, courteous, kind and above all a remarkable ""skin Doctor"
Dr. Alan Greenspan,"Having an established history of skin cancer, I needed a good dermatologist since moving back to the East coast who accepted my insurance. I was recommended to Dr. Greenspan's office by another medical practice. My experience with this practice has been very positive. I had the privileged of being treated by both Dr. Greenspan as well as Dr. Veritas. Both doctor's are very nice and thorough. My questions and concerns were addressed. Their staff is very nice and did well accommodating my schedule"
Dr. Alan Greenspan,Excellent care.
Dr. Catherine Ding,"The Dr. had great reviews so I made an apt. at her office. Unfortunately, she's more interested in pushing her own business-money making agenda in selling their own ointments and skin-care items. If I needed those, I'd just buy them for cheaper online! I don't like going to doctors who are essentially business men or women in her case, trying to make a quick buck more off of patients is highly unprofessional in her field. I would recommend going to a Derm. with more experience than her"
Dr. Catherine Ding,The reviews are true. Dr. Ding is a careful and considerate physician. Wonderful! She is my new Dermatologist
Dr. Catherine Ding,"Dr. Ding and all the staffs are very friendly, patience, and informative. She make sure that I understand everything clearly and take time to answer all my concerns and questions. Dr.Ding and her staffs pay very close attention to detail and take such a good care during every procedures"
Dr. Catherine Ding,"The level of service was superb. Was very detailed with the diagnosis, treatment and side effects. Their attention to detail was very good; they double check the questions I've answered via ZocDoc and refined some of the answer making sure everything was accurate. Office was very clean but that might be because it is a fairly new establishment. It might a little hard to find where the office is because there are 3 offices with the same street address"
Dr. Catherine Ding,"Dr Catherine Ding was great. I came with a dermalogical concern and she worked with me to take a course of action. The office is new and clean, and the front desk staff were polite and courteous. It was also a short wait before seeing the doctor, which I appreciated. I definitely recommend Dr Ding"
Ashton Frulla,Explained and preformed the process with ease.
Ashton Frulla,"There's nothing like waking up with flaw-free skin. I truly can't thank Ashton enough. I usually get a few razor bumps when I shave my neck, but when I recently trimmed my beard down to stubble a host of problems popped up. I was left with inflamed red skin and breakouts all underneath my stubble that only got worse with creams and cleansers. Ashton set me up with a few simple products and I was cleared up in 2 days. Now I'm prepared to manage the skin under my beard long term"
Ashton Frulla,"Ashton was so great, he went beyond my expectation. He eased my concern and he made me feel better about a potentially embarrassing skin issue! He was so professional Yet laid back and friendly. Ashton took the time to explain each ailment and medicines in terms I understood."
Ashton Frulla,"If I could, I would rate this doctor with a million stars.! After visiting Dr Ashton Frulla, I realized I don't have to look for any other dermatologist anymore ! His knowledge, patience, and kindness, meant everything to me. He took all the time needed to listen to me, to exam, and give me his opinion. Trusting and feeling comfortable with a doctor, is the first step on the healing process. Suelibeth his assistant is amazing! Thanks both for your sweetness ! I will recommed you to everyone"
Ashton Frulla,"Saw Ashton at 220 Front St location for skin check. Great bedside manner, thorough examination! He was excellent. Highly recommend!"
Dr. Robert Buka,"Visited 220 Front Street; clean office a long wait. Dr. Buka was recommended by a colleague who’s satisfied and has good results. The receptionist wasn’t helpful when asked about authorization needed for medication and call back the pharmacy required. She actually tried to delegate the front office task of prior authorization to me. Dr. Buka is professional, friendly and had good bedside manor. The cost of his products are pricey"
Dr. Robert Buka,"I visited the 214 Sullivan Street location to have some skin tags and spots looked at. I have to say that out of all of the doctors visits I have ever gone to this was the most professional and well executed experience I have ever had. The staff and doctors were extremely knowledgeable, professional and caring. I look forward to a long term relationship with Bobby’s practice for my future dermatology needs. - Jason"
Dr. Robert Buka,"Be aware! I've been at his UWS location before once and I liked my experience. I came back to remove a skin tag in the same area as I had before. The doctor told me that it's wart, not a skin tag. I wasn't advice about the price. I had no idea that procedure doesn't guarantee the results. I would NEVER do it if I knew that the cost would be $975 for a 10 minutes visit. And now I have two warts instead of one! It's clearly fraud to make more money on people like me who believe doctors"
Dr. Robert Buka,"This was the WORST experience I have EVER had at a doctor's office. Both my parents are physicians, so I know better than most that seeing patients on-time is hard, but I sat in the waiting room for 2 HOURS! I ended up walking out without seeing a doctor or any sort of apology/follow-up. Overall, it was clear that this doctor overbooks his schedule with appointments, which means that money is more important to him than actually delivering care to his patients"
Dr. Robert Buka,"At least their office was nice. BUT, I didn't feel the physician's assistant was very helpful. Also they are catering to many people but if they call themselves pediatrician dermatologists, they should also have a space for infants. No table against a wall or anything.. A very uncomfortable long wait and reclining seat in the room that is really low and with gaps.. Very hard to put and observe a child in. The assistant acted very coldly about it and didn't help me at all. Consultation was weak"
Dr. Robert Buka,"Very nice office, efficiency of the staff will tell you, your wait time. Dr Buka is very detail with his patient and explaining your condition"
Dr. Robert Buka,"I went in for my annual skin check up and review of my ongoing skin issues with rosacea and eczema. Dr Buka was nice, quick and efficient. He noticed an issue I had for a while and suggested a quick fix and was able to do it right then with a cyst I had. I highly recommend him for any dermatology needs"
Dr. Robert Buka,Returned after a previous visit for a cyst- Dr. Buka injected and it was reduced and pain free in a couple hours after leaving office
Dr. Robert Buka,"Accurately diagnosed problem within minutes, biopsy later proved it true....commendable"
Dr. Robert Buka,"I had a rather embarrassing condition that I thought was something else completely. Dr Buka reassured the Hypochondriac in me it wasn't what I thought it was, and clearly explained the condition. The whole experience was great, and if something else pops up, I'm sure that I'll be back here to be taken care of"
Dr. Robert Buka,He is fine the office is the worst in the city. A lot of shady billing practices. I would steer clear. everywhere is better in that regard
Dr. Robert Buka,"Everyone was extremely helpful from the intake nurse Diana, to the NP studying underneath him. The diagnosis was quickly resolved and thoroughly explained to me, along with treatment options. I was given options and recommendations without pressure. Felt comfortable the entire time"
Dr. Robert Buka,Very nice and listened to everything I had to say and the staff is very nice. Best dermatology visit i have ever had I will definitely come back.
Dr. Robert Buka,"No waiting time, got a skin scan, asked some questions, had a short procedure, and out in no time"
Dr. Robert Buka,"Great experience! Dr. Buka was friendly, attentive and clear in his explanations. Wait time was minimal/non-existent"
Dr. Barry Goldman,"I switched a few offices until I found the right fit. Dr. Goldman and his entire staff are very professional, they make the entire process easy. The medical esthetician is the best I have ever experienced. Thanks to this office I regained my great skin"
Dr. Barry Goldman,"Finding a doctor that can not only treat your condition effectively, but in a way that makes you feel comfortable is a rarity. Dr. Goldman pulls that off with ease. He takes a methodical approach to treating his patients, carefully balancing the side-effects of a given treatment relative to the potential upside. He is a great listener, and takes his time to ensure all of your questions are answered. The staff at the front desk are also very friendly and do an amazing job scheduling patients in"
Dr. Barry Goldman,"I have been a patient of Dr. Goldman's practice for several years. He is attentive, well informed on the latest developments and strives hard to help improve his patients dermatological health. He focusses a lot patient comfort - especially when potentially painful treatments are required - and invests time in the long term well being of the patient. I have already recommended Dr Goldman to my family and friends"
Dr. Barry Goldman,"I did meet Dr. Goldman back in 2001 when he had his office near Wall Street. I have been following him since than. He opened another office in the UES and I did go there to see, and now I go to see him in his office downtown Manhattan.  One of the best Dermatologist I have ever meet. Vary kind and down to earth. He always make me feel welcomed and he gives me all the time I need. His staff are super nice.  I will never see another Dr"
Kara Hartmann,good
Kara Hartmann,This place is very lovely i am happy i was seen here
Kara Hartmann,loved it. Kara was great. Very imformative. Found a new dermatology home
Kara Hartmann,"Kara was very warm, comforting, clear, and informative. She made sure I understood everything in a kind and positive way and I really appreciated it."
Kara Hartmann,"First time at a dermatologist - just went in for yearly skin screening. They were so nice, fast and very informative! Thanks!!"
Kara Hartmann,kara was so helpful and friendly during my visit!! she was able to make me feel comfortable given the sensitive situation and that I was a male. she answered all my questions and made me better quick 
Kara Hartmann,ara took the time to answer all of my questions and provide guidance on treatment options. She is very personable and helpful!
Kara Hartmann,"Absolute delight, smart, and patient! Would definitely come back just for he"
Kara Hartmann,"If I had any, this review would be a lot longer"
Kara Hartmann,Visit went very well.
Kara Hartmann,"It was good, better than I expected."
Kara Hartmann,i love this place very warming nice atmosphere! professional service i would highly refer family & friends
Kara Hartmann,easy to talk to
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,"Although it can take some time to get an appointment, it is well worth the wait. I’ve been to several dermatologist, Dr. Kahn is the very best."
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,He is worth the wait! He is confident and helped my daughter with her severe eczema.
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,Helpful and understanding.
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,"My visit was for a Rx special prescription refill. With that said, Dr. Kahn and the staff were all amazing and very helpful. Highly recommend!"
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,I am an RN on Staten Island and my previous Dermatologist of many years passed away. My son is a patient of Dr. Kahn in Manhattan & recommended him. I felt he was caring & knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend him to others
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,"A very compassionate person who is thorough when examining for skin cancer, and I've seen him for years"
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,Unreliable. Dr. Kahn prescribed medication that was not covered by insurance and too expensive to pay for out of pocket. The pharmacy and myself called his office multiple times without getting returned calls. The pharmacy offered to send one of their reps to his office to see if they could get him to prescribe an alternative. Rather go to a doctor's office that knows how to return a call
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,"Best dermatologist I've ever had and I've had several. Thorough, competent, trustworthy and extremely pleasant and kind physician"
Dr. Hirshel Kahn,"Excellent attention, review and follow up to a serious skin condition. Was extremely helpful in getting me to deal with and cure a very uncomfortable condition of the mouth. Dr. Kahn is the best for caring and handling a difficult situation to the cure. This was several years ago, and I still follow up with his associate, Dr. Carolin Penrose. Also an excellent, caring and thorough doctor."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Kabigting is a knowledgeable, patient doctor with a wonderful bedside manner. His whole staff is wonderful as well. After years of suffering from alopecia he finally helped find me a treatment that is working."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,I almost don't want to recommend because they his calendar will be full. He was on point and through. Dr. Kabigting is permanent in my contact list.
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Excellent bedside manner, thorough but efficient! Would recommend whole heartedly"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Clearly a smart guy but like others have said, he has never taken the time to listen to my concerns or explore options based on my medical history. I never saw him for more than 10 minutes. I came in for a hair loss issue and after a year of zero improvement, he assured me I looked better even though I’ve lost significantly more hair since I started seeing him. Rather than talk to me about it, he prescribed me a medication I was uncomfortable taking without doing the proper blood work first."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,I recommend Dr. Kabigting to everybody I know. Acne really took hit a hit to my confidence and thanks to him I can now wear no makeup with more confidence than I had WITH makeup before. I’ve been seeing him for over a year and drive very far to see him because he’s THAT worth it. He is absolute angel sent from the skin gods
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"I'm very happy with Dr. Fil, he is treating me for a rare skin condition in my scalp. I'd been dealing with ineffective treatments for this condition by 2 other dermatologists with no improvements for almost 10 years before I started seeing Dr. Fil late last year. He immediately diagnosed my problem and recommended a treatment; today after 7 months under Dr. Fil's care my scalp has already improved far beyond what the other dermatologists I saw in the past 10 years ever achieved."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Kabigting is hands down the BEST dermatologist I have ever had. I have been suffering from acne since a very young age. Dr. Kabigting was referred to me by a friend who sees him as well and her skin has dramatically changed since she has been under his care, that made me want to try him. I work is very effective, and in moments of doubt Dr. Kabigting's words of encouragement to hang on and believe in the process are just soo up lifting"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Hands down, the most patient-friendly, supportive, and informed MD I've seen in my life."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,Dr. Fil is amazing! He really listened to my skin concerns and was super patient. He makes sure you understand your diagnosis and is super easy to talk to. He also is quick to get back to you with any questions you may have. I have referred multiple colleagues to him and they have all had more than satisfactory consultations with him.

He also is quick to get back to you with any questions you may have. I have referred multiple colleagues to him and they have all had more than satisfactory consultations with him.
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. ""Fil"" Kabigting is fantastic. I was struggling with seborrheic dermatitis and the treatments prescribed by another dermatologist caused me to develop both rosacea and perioral dermatitis. Fed up, I went to see Dr. Fil, described the symptoms and treatments used before, and he came up with a good approach to get my skin back to normal. Additionally, Dr. Fil is genuinely kind and committed to helping his patients. He responds to emails very quickly"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Nicest office I have stepped foot in. Everything brand new. Literally zero waiting time. Dr Fil showed me HOPE and compassion with a condition (alopecia) that doctors have literally told me ""nothing I can do! get a wig!"" Dr. Fil has me on a breakthru medication that is working. He and his team have taken much of their time writing appeals and pleas to my insurance company and pharm company to help me to afford the Rx. This is the doctor and team I have been searching for for years! Thank You!!"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,He takes the time to listen and remembers the small details that you tell him about your life.
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"In a nutshell, Dr. Kabigting will see you for 10 minutes, look at a skin rash, tell you it's a skin rash, prescribe you a cream, and charge you $530 for the visit. After weeks of chasing down someone at Columbia doctors who could give me an explanation of services (the bill had nothing but the $530 amount in it), the answer I got was ""It's what the department charges."" Don't go see him or any dermatologist with Columbia doctors unless you're ok with being extorted."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,been visiting for 3 years. easy to understand and explain condition to. never have to wait for long time. Happy with the treatment
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,Dr. Kabigting is very professional and caring. He always addresses any concerns I have and follows up closely. He takes his time answering questions and makes the visit a comfortable experience.
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,Excellent bedside manner and very thorough!
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,Consultation was 5 minutes. Did not take the time to listen to concerns. Did not ask if I had any questions. Would not recommend
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"I have been going to see Dr. Filamer Kabigting for over a year and can’t say enough about his care. His professionalism is second to none and it is reflected in his efficient, thorough, and effective treatment explanations and guidance. Dr. Kabigting has always worked to address my every question and offered thoughtful feedback during difficult medical decisions. I truly appreciated his approach of treating me as a whole. He is truly the best dermatologist"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Kabigting is friendly, kind, and thorough. He has fantastic bedside manner and is very solutions-oriented. By far the best dermatologist I've ever visited"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Fil Kabigting is awesome. He is quick and efficient, coming up with a plan of action or diagnosis quickly, and then talking through it with you. He is friendly and kind. He makes you feel like you are speaking to a friend rather than a doctor. I would highly recommend him"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Fil is an excellent doctor. He is thorough, caring and personable. My visit was informative yet I was out in under 30 min. Conveniently located in midtown made visiting him during lunch a breeze"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"I came to Dr. Kabigting after I had seen two other dermatologists who didn't have any idea what was wrong with my skin, how to treat me, or even how to give me some relief from my distress. Dr. Kabigting diagnosed my condition and gave me two prescriptions that began working the very first day, and by the second day, my distress had significantly improved. I told Dr. Kabigting that I was very, very grateful that he would see me as a new patient. I will strongly recommend Dr. Kabigting."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Kabigting is a very competent specialist. I came to him for a mole removal. He examined not only my problem mole, he looked on all my moles, which is very professional. I was surprised when my mole was removed in seconds, absolutely painless. It took him just one session. My previous dermatologist would bring me to the office for a couple of times prior of doing something, charging for every visit of course. Dr. Kabigting doesn't play around!I would definitely recommend him to all my friends"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,I felt like I could trust him right away. the only negative feedback i have is not about dr. filamer. the gown I was given had a piece of gum stuck to it.
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,I will definitely recommend Dr. Kabigting to family and friends. Quickly diagnosed my condition and provided a solution. Very professional and courteous
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Great dermatologist! Dr. Kabigting is very knowlagable, and what's most important, he dosnt rush and takes time with his patients. I definitely recommend this doctor."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Kabigting was ,firstly, very friendly and welcoming. He was very understanding of my condition and was informative. He is a very precise and intelligent doctor and I am grateful to have met with him today. I would certainly recommend him to others"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,VERY likely He was VERY knowledgeable and friendly
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Filamer is the best! Friendly, supportive, attentive and easy to make an appointment with!"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"He has done an excellent job caring for me. I have been to five doctors with my condition and he has been the most helpful in terms of treatment and patient care. Not that the others were bad, he is exceptionally good. He listens and take effective action to problems with insurance companies which can be as important as the treatment itself. He is very careful and thorough in prescribing and monitoring with my medications. I would be very glad to recommend him to friends or relatives"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Great bedside manner. easy to talk to, very efficient and informed diagnosis with great explanation and course of treatment, would recommend to others"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Very happy with the experience. He always gets me in before the appointment is even scheduled, and I never have to wait"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"I'm not sure what happened the day I saw Dr. Kabigting, but I do not share the positive experience many others had. From the beginning the experience was not good. The security guard was rude and the nurses barely even acknowledged me. Dr. Kabigting seemed kind enough, but he was very dismissive and did not really care to hear what I had to say. The whole time I felt like he was trying to rush so he could see his next patient. I would not return or recommend."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Kabigting is a friendly physician. While he was patient in answering my many questions about adult acne, he was not proactive at all in exploring all of the options with me. I tried a regimen, and was 10% worsening instead of improvement. Then he said it's probably time to move on to acutane. But I couldn't start it for another 3 months, and he suggested keeping me on the same regimen for another 3 months. He did not mention birth control or any other options until I brought it up."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,Dr. Kabigting was very nice! He examined me very professionally and was attentive to the issues that brought me into the doctor's office. He also coached me through the biopsy process like a pro and it was painless.
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Kabigting and Nurse Michelle were amazing! This was the best experience I've had with ColumbiaDoctors this year. The office staff was friendly and inviting, the clinic was clean and quiet, and Dr. Kabigting and Michelle were friendly and made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Saw Dr Kabigting for the first time today. He is a lovely person with a warm bedside manner. Answered my questions calmly and completely. And even wrote down the medical terms for my condition - without my asking - so that I could read up on my own. Will definitely refer to friends and family, as well as return for additional treatment"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"My experience with Dr. Kabigting has been wonderful. Scheduling online and with his office is so easy. His staff (reception, MA's) is very welcoming and very efficient. I've never waited more than ten minutes to be seen. Dr. Kabigting is awesome - approachable, knowledgeable and the treatment he's put me on has worked tremendously. He listens to my concerns and addresses them appropriately. I'm so happy with my outcomes and can now get married with the best skin I've had in years"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr. Fil always puts me at ease. He genuinely cares about his patients, and listens to concerns in a nonjudgmental manner. He explains everything so thoroughly! Great bedside manner and very friendly & relatable. Every experience has been pleasant and seamless"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"So glad I found Dr. Fil! Making the appt online was simple and quick. The staff was friendly, wait time a breeze (5min). He addressed all my concerns more than adequately addressed and didn't rush me out of the room"
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,Great doctor who took the time to explain things and put me at ease. Will definitely recommend him to others
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,He is fantastic
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Dr Kabigting has a pleasant professional demeanor. He made me feel comfortable, listened to my medical concern, and answered all of my questions satisfactorily. I could not be more pleased and satisfied with the immediate results. I highly recommend Dr. Kabigting to my family and friends."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"Excellent ""bedside manner"" He is easy to talk to and listens to his patients."
Dr. Filamer Kabigting,"He's absolutely wonderful! From first moment's meeting (accidental, as Col Pres. 51st St. Derm. happened to be offering an 'open house' free skin check on a day I'd scheduled an US) I was delighted by his attentive and gracious manner. He is clearly very smart, empathic, communicative, focussed, yet patient. I scheduled an appointment right away, to have him follow up on his observations. I've seen many Derms. over years, including renowned, but he will be my go-to from now on. Lucky me."
Dr. Jesse Lewin,"I highly recommend Dr. Lewin to anyone seeking a surgical dermatologist. I appreciated his personal follow-up calls after surgery and found him to be informative and caring. Daniela, Kerri and his entire staff are personable, professional and kind. The overall service is excellent. Dr. Lewin is a skilled surgeon. Allowing my daughter in the exam room to explain and consult about the Mohs procedure on my nose was extremely consoling for me. I healed beautifully; the final result is fantastic"
Dr. Jesse Lewin,"Dr. Lewin is an exceptional caring and personable physician. He was able to dramatically reduce my mom's anxiety about her skin cancer diagnosis and treated her with kindness and expertise! Not only is she cancer free, but also thrilled with the cosmetic outcome! My family strongly recommends Dr. Lewin to anyone seeking dermatological care. He's the ABSOLUTE best!!"
Dr. Jesse Lewin,Dr. Lewin is one of the best doctors I have ever encountered. He is highly knowledgeable and extremely personable. He performed surgery on my right hip removing a growth the size of a tennis ball. Dr. Lewin explained every aspect of the surgery including any negative effects that might occur. I didn't feel any pain during the surgery. Everything worked out well for me. He and his staff were extremely caring and gave me detailed post-op instructions. I highly recommend Dr. Lewin.
Dr. Jesse Lewin,"I could not wait to leave his office and brag to my family and friends how amazing this doctor is! Not only I was seen by a proper doctor and not a physician assistant, he went into every details in regards to my skin condition and addressed other issues he noticed while I was there. He's detail oriented, very gentle, polite and patient, His office staff is extremely helpful and polite as well. I am confident i finally found ""the one"" and recommending him fully to anyone in need of a real doctor"
Dr. Jesse Lewin,Amazingly professional and warm! He even played music of my choice to help me get thru my surgery comfortably. His staff is just as amazing!! Thanks Dr. Lewin
Dr. Jesse Lewin,"Dr. Lewin is by far the best Mohs surgeon in practice. He was prompt, attentive, detail-oriented, and careful"

Dr. Lindsey Bordone,"Dr. Bordone is the best Dermatologist I've ever been to. She takes her time and is very thorough. She has so many patients but she remembers each one. I recommend her to everyone, but specifically those of us who have to have a skin check every six months. She doesn't miss anything."
Dr. Lindsey Bordone,"I was by dr. Bordone and she did not look at my skin at all, and what she gave me made my skin condition worse then ever before, i I’m totally disappointed, and I told my friend that recommended her that should not recommend her anymore to anyone."
Dr. Lindsey Bordone,She is terrific. I recommend her to all of my coworkers

Dr. Lindsey Bordone,"Best Dr I've ever had!! I have been seeing Dr. Bordone for nearly 2 years. I suffer from a skin disease called Vitiligo. Due to this, I visit her office 1-2x per week. From the day of my first appointment to the present, Dr Bordone has shown how passionate she is about her profession and her patients. She cares about my treatment and the progress I have made.

She took time to talk to me and most importantly she listened to what I had to say. I did not feel rushed during our visit at all. When doing a procedure or prescribing a treatment plan she explained exactly why she recommended that course and explained step by step what the plan was going to be and what I could expect"
Dr. Lindsey Bordone,"She's an excellent doctor-- she listens, empathizes with my concerns, and explains things clearly. I never feel rushed or unimportant. She's willing to try new treatments and is always available in between appointments if I need to contact her. She's also very smart and clearly up to date with the latest literature."
Dr. Lindsey Bordone,"Dr. Bordone is awesome! Appointments are easily made, wait time to be seen is minimal, and she is thorough and comforting throughout the visit. She takes her time, validates my concerns, and explains everything in terms I can understand. I travel from CT. and it is so worth it!

I not only would recommend her to family and friends, I do so because she is not only knowledgeable, but she makes you feel like she is on your own personal wellness team"
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"I saw Dr. Moritz bc I had fibroids and wanted to discuss my options. At every visit, Dr. Moritz was supportive, answered my questions, made me laugh, and gave me all the information that I needed to make an informed decision. Given my situation, the best decision was to have surgery. Before, during and after the surgery, he and his team were supportive, attentive and all-around amazing. I received the best possible care and I highly recommend Dr. Moritz"
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"Dr Moritz is excellent. I can't recommend him highly enough. He's been my doctor through several health issues and has always given me the best care and treatment. I first went to him for a second opinion, I wasn't even his patient and he fitted me in for an evaluation that saved me from making what would have been an unnecessary and potentially detrimental surgery. He got me through two complicated pregnancies. He really listens to his patients, is kind, and seriously knows his stuff."
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"Dr. Moritz delivered my twin girls earlier this year. Throughout the pregnancy he was supportive, clear, and ready with a warm joke. Between appointments, I would email him questions and he would respond quickly (usually within an hour). During my lador, he supported me and my birth plan, made me feel safe, and advocated for me and my babies needs. When my girls were in distress, he moved quickly and made sure everyone was safe. I am forever grateful."
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"I have been Dr. Moritz's patient since 1997. After a long search I found the most caring, compassionate and competent GYN/OB. I never forget our first encounter, he said, 'look at me and tell me how this is affecting your daily life?' I am well aware of your medical condition, but how are you dealing with it. He gave me several options and the pros and cons. I asked a lot of questions and he patiently answered them, repeatedly. A true doctor. Recommended to many and they are delighted."
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"Dr Moritz is clearly resting on his laurels as a doctor. He never bothered to check my chart ahead of appointments. He frequently canceled regularly scheduled appointments and ran late. On one occasion he caused me to miss an important meeting after rescheduling and then making me wait over two hours. On the day of my csectiontion, he told me several times that I was a “nasty woman”.This obviously added a lot of anxiety for me ahead of him About to cut open my stomac"
Dr. Jacques Moritz,Amazing doctor! Makes you feel comfortable. Dr. Moritz legitimately cares for his patients. You feel like you have his full attention during your appt. He explains things clearly. Very knowledgeable.
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"I have been a patient of Dr. Moritz for more than 10 years now. I have recommended his services at least 4 times all with excellent feedback. Dr. Mortiz is thorough, maintains a level of expertise unmatched in his field, and professional.. If I could use him as my primary physician I would"
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"Dr. Moritz is by far the best Gyn I have been to. After visiting many other Doctors to figure out what was the case of my pain, he was the only that found the cause, just by touching my stomach. If I could give him 1 million stars, I would."
Dr. Jacques Moritz,If I could give him 10 starts I would . The best absolute best ob/gyn dr . I was a high risk pregnancy but he made me feel very relaxed the entire pregnancy it's true the wait is long but that's because he doesn't rush his patients and everyone in that office wants to see dr moritz not the other Drs. The delivery went fine too and he did all the follow ups . Over all an excellent doctor.
Dr. Jacques Moritz,"kind, compassionate, generous with his time, knowledgeable. Dr. Mortiz made me feel a human being again."
Dr. Daniel Stein,Highly recommend got us pregnant with our 2 month old daughter. Will definitely go back for our other children. We have two more embryos (girls) on ice
Dr. Daniel Stein,"Dr Stein was great. Very down to earth and easy to talk to. I was apprehensive about doing IVF at all and instead of being dismissive like other doctors he let me think about it and also agreed to try a couple more IUIs although he advised that the best option for us was IVF. Although we had heard this before, his approach was much more gentle and allowed me to come to terms with the idea of IVF in my own time. We were very lucky on our first try and conceived Boy and Girl twins right away."
Dr. Daniel Stein,"I am currently pregnant with #2 thanks to Dr. Stein. He was also responsible for our happy, healthy first child so there was no other doctor we would have rather worked with when we decided to try for a sibling. He is honest, warm and (arguably more important) a genius at what he does. Both times, we were successful at the first attempt (IVF+PGS/FET), which we attribute a huge part to Dr. Stein's skill and experience. We would 100% recommend him to anyone in need of an RE!"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"I'm 12 weeks pregnant thanks to Dr. Daniel Stein at RMA. My husband and I have worked with him for approximately 1 year and ultimately did IVF with PGS. Dr. Stein is very direct, honest, and to the point. His honesty and knowledge of fertility treatments got us to where we are today. His entire office staff is warm, reassuring, and provided us with a very positive experience. At RMA you are not just a number. They made a stressful process as smooth as can be and we highly recommend Dr. Stein."
Dr. Daniel Stein,"I recently went through an egg freeze cycle with Dr. Stein at RMA. I received excellent and attentive care by Dr. Stein and his nurse team at RMA; as a result of their diligence, I was very pleased with the result. My case required some thought and attention to obtain the good result. Dr. Stein's excellent care is in contrast to the sloppy and lack of care I received from Dr. Nicole Noyes at NYU 3 years ago"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"Actually Zero Stars! Run far away from this doctor! He not only misdiagnosed me, and told me I had ""bad eggs"", he also lacks the latest advances in the field. If referred here- please get a second or even third opinion!!! Better yet, save yourself the time and do not make an appointment!"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"I would definitely recommend Dr. Stein and I would look to work with him again if in the future we decide to try for another child. Many reproductive endocrinology clinics operate using standard protocols depending on the infertility diagnosis. After our first IVF round failed, Dr. Stein took a different approach, customizing my medication protocol and it worked! I'm currently 11w pregnant. The office is clean and efficient, with minimal wait time. Staff was always friendly and helpful."
Dr. Daniel Stein,"let's begin -DO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR! I have NEVER written a negative review in my life. But after this experience I feel compelled to share my experience. with Dr. Daniel Stein. He brought nothing positive to the table and didn't offer us much advice. Then, a few weeks later he calls me to see if I a interested in proceeding with him. After my response was ""no"" he HUNG UP the telephone on me! I am writing this review because this process is hard enough and no one should experience this."
Dr. Daniel Stein,"Dr Stein and the team at RMA NY made this emotional and difficult journey an amazing one. I am forever grateful for them. Dr. Stein and his team treated me with the utmost care and professionalism. They were attentive and answered every one of my questions, no matter how crazy. If you're looking for a RE that gets results, I would highly recommend Dr. Stein and his team at RMA NY. Thank you for everything!"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"Dr. Stein was compassionate, clear in his communications with us, and effective. As I look forward to the birth of our child, I am so grateful not only for what Dr. Stein did for us but for his professionalism and kindness"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"Dr Stein and his staff are more than I could have hoped for. My husband and I were blown away by the level of care, attention, and knowledge provided by Dr Stein and his team. The best!"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"Dr. Stein is extremely professional and honest. He will tell you the accurate answer even if that is not what you want to hear. He is also very compassionate and always makes a point to make you feel comfortable. Great sense of humor! He makes his patients feel at ease through this very emotional, difficult and time consuming process. He is awesome! His Spanish is great"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"There are no words to describe how grateful I am to Dr. Stein and his team at RMA of New York. Between Dr. Stein and the phenomenal nurses, I have never felt more cared for or in better hands than I did with that medical team. Dr. Stein's expertise in the area of fertility is not only astounding but his sensitivity and caring is what separates him from the rest. Life changing experience."

Dr. Daniel Stein,"Dr Stein is the most amazing Doctor. Very professional , caring and empathetic. The whole RMA staff is wonderful and very friendly"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"Dr. Stein at RMA westside was and is fantastic. We saw him because of male factor infertility and he was honest, thorough and extremely clear. We ended going straight to ivf with icsi, which worked on our first try. I felt the doctor really got the medication dosing for me spot on and I think it was moderate all things considering, which I was pleased with as I had really minimal side effects. We are happy to say we graduated with flying colors and are now seeing my ob/gyn. I'm 35 and DH is 36"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"My experience at RMA of NY has been hands down the best clinical experience of my life, let alone for something as challenging and heartbreaking as infertility. After two years at another NYC clinic where I felt doctors had given up on me, Dr. Stein gave me and my husband the hope and compassionate care to keep trying. Now, after just one cycle of IVF, I am 9 weeks pregnant and we cannot thank Dr. Stein and his office enough! Save yourself time and heartache and go straight to Dr. Stein!"
Dr. Daniel Stein,"My Gynecologist Dr. Robin Brown suggested that I meet with Dr. Stein over a year ago, so my husband and I did. Dr. Stein took his time explaining our options and the next steps. We started our journey this year and I am proud to say that I am 8 weeks pregnant and was discharged today. Dr. Stein and his staff in all areas, make you feel comfortable, they are reliable and are always available to answer any questions. Thank you, Dr. Stein and RMA of NY for our little blessing, due April 2017"
Dr. Raymond Wong,"Dr Raymond Wong was one of the best gynecologists I’ve ever had. He was so kind and gentle and he always welcomed me with a warm smile. I always felt very comfortable and safe in his care. The only reason why I stopped seeing him is because I moved away from NYC when I got married. Whenever I’m on the hunt for a new gynecologist, which I am now, I think of him and I hope the next one is just as good as he was to me"

She took her time, listened, had amazing bedside manner and just made me feel a comfort I have not felt before which enabled me to be more open / honest with her about my care and things important to me to discuss. I have already recommended her to friends and just feel extremely lucky that I got in while she is still accepting new patients - I’m sure that won’t last"

I cannot speak highly enough of her, there's not enough space in this review for me to give her all the praise she deserves"
Dr. Szilvia Nagy,"I can't say enough good things about Dr. Nagy. She is highly competent, warm, caring, and efficient.

Dr. Dhruti Mehta,"Personally I don’t see why these comments are sooo bad. My first visit with Dr Mehta was amazing she made me feel comfortable. She sat down right in front of me, with her full attention, addressing my every concern about my planned pregnancy. She was sweet and kind and took her time. The only bad thing is that most of my other appointments we’re rushed .. we didn’t talk much .. but she did answer my questions if I had any. I’d like her to take longer with me with every appt. otherwise great"
Dr. Dhruti Mehta,"Dr Mehta rushes you through each appointment and does not care to listen to her patients what so ever! She is patronizing when she does speak, and I’ve left each of my prenatal appointments with a bad taste in my mouth. Learn how to listen and have some bedside manner if you want to be a decent OB GYN"
Dr. Dhruti Mehta,"She was far more concerned about payment for tests than actually listening to the patient. Most of the questions I had for her were replied with ""I don't know"". She is not knowledgeable of anything related to obstetrics or gynecology. Additionally, you can feel her disrespect through the phone. Dr. Mehta is just rude, unfriendly, and incapable. I am never visiting her again, and I don't recommend her"
Dr. Dhruti Mehta,"I'd NEVER recommend Dr. Mehta to anyone, especially 1st time moms. She's careless, not patient-friendly, does not follow-up with her patients and is simply unreliable. I am a 1st time mom who's had a rough start w/a well-planned pregnancy. After my 1st prenatal visit where she DID NOTHING but fill my head w/doubts & unnecessary worries, she promised to call me and discuss test result the next day. 3 days went by and I had to ask clinic to have a diff. Dr. read the results. Again, NOT reliable!"
Dr. Dhruti Mehta,"My wife, Ursula, is a nurse who works 12-hour shifts on her feet in a psychiatric hospital in The Bronx. My wife calls me crying every day that she is exhausted and her swollen feet are in a lot of pain. We asked this doctor today for a letter that my wife can submit to her employer so she can stop working now, two weeks before she's due. She would only give my wife a letter stating that she is 37 weeks pregnant. That's it! A useless letter. This woman is a real passive-aggressive. Stay away"
Dr. Dhruti Mehta,"I definitely recommend Dr. Mehta! She is a very present and caring doctor with lots of knowledge and great people skills! Very professional and trustworthy. Office is clean and staff is very friendly and helpful. They take the stress/nerves out of the visits! I found her after searching online, so hopefully this review will help others decide too. I've already learned more from her in a few visits than from my former OBGYN"
Dr. Michael Orofino,"The worst experience ever, the man never took a word I said seriously, he is that bad I never went back for my Checkup after my c section, and of course never got a phone call to remind me to come back, shows all they cared. The day of my c section in walked into the room and never even said hello to me, my husband was disgusted, Please restore your terrible"
Dr. Michael Orofino,Dr. Orofino is the best OBGYN I’ve ever been to. He delivered my son via c-section & I barely have a scar. He made me feel comfortable during my entire pregnancy & I trust him & his staff explicitly.
Dr. Michael Orofino,Never. The worst doctor I have ever seen. Messed up my rxns multiple times and never took a single concern seriously. DO NOT go to him. The only good part is that his staff is nice.
Dr. Michael Orofino,"He's honest, always available, down to earth and knows how to lighten any situation. His staff is amazing"
Dr. Michael Orofino,"THE.WORST. I can't even begin to describe how rude and unprofessional this weasel of a man is. Went in for an ultrasound and simply got the worst treatment ever. I left the office crying. Cold, cold, as were his staff. I will never step foot there again. RUN AWAY"
Dr. Michael Orofino,"Dealing with this practice is relaxed, competent, professional, attentive. Dr Orofino makes me feel I am in reasonable and highly experienced care."
Dr. Michael Orofino,RUDE DOCTOR! PLEASE AVOID! RUN AWAY! WORSE DOCTOR EVER!

You can tell he is passionate about his career. During the pregnancy, labor and even after birth he was so professional and caring. Highly recommend him"
Dr. Adam Shoman,I came to Dr Shoman in my 5th month of pregnancy since I was not happy with my earlier doctor. Right from the first visit I realized choosing Dr. Shoman was a very good decision.

During the labor process he was in constant touch with us explaining each and every step that was going on in the hospital which was very comforting esp since I m a first time mom
Dr. Adam Shoman,"Best Doctor in the World? If I were a betting woman, I would bet on this. Dr. Shoman’s bedside manner made me feel safe, secure and gave me faith when I had doubts.

He thoroughly explained every process and procedure from start to finish. thank you Dr shoman"

Dr. Adam Shoman,"I went to see Dr. Shoman because I've been experiencing some unusual side effects of my Mirena IUD, so I wanted to have it taken out. Instead of listening to my issues with the Mirena and helping me find a solution he told me that I ""shouldn't be having side effects"". So, to reassure me that everything is just in my head like the silly girl I am, he wrote me a prescription for Prozac. Wow, what a gem of a doctor"
Dr. Adam Shoman,This doctor is amazing. I left my previous doctor to go to him because of the great experiences my friends have had with him. He is very kind and soft spoken. Extremely knowledgeable and thorough when explaining things to his patient. You feel as thought you have a relationship with your doctor not a doctor. I recommend him to anyone but especially to someone who wants a doctor who knows his patience one by one
Dr. Adam Shoman,"Fantastic doctor! I was Dr Abdelghani's patient from the start of my pregnancy through to after the delivery of my healthy baby boy.

Dr. Sabrina Nilufar,She needs an attitude adjustment. I am going to switch doctors. She's unprofessional and talks to everyone around her in a condescending manner. She's also very unorganized. If she could communicate better maybe things would run more smoother with her patients
Dr. Sabrina Nilufar,"I left crying; she was very rude, tough and she had a bad bedside manner. She had no compassion whatsoever to my situation, she was talking over me all the time like she was lecturing me and when I try to explain what I'm feeling she tells me in a condescending way to let her finish! she didn't take into consideration that I was in pain and didn't even suggest any painkillers or anything. It was like I am begging her for medical attention"
Dr. Sabrina Nilufar,I’m 66 year old but this was one of worst doctor I ever visit in my life
Dr. Mark Moradi,"Love Dr. Moradi, but unfortunately I will be switching doctors as his staff is extremely unprofessional and unpleasant. Specifically Anna and Melba whom which I will file further complaints and fraud against."
Dr. Mark Moradi,I have been with Dr. Moradi for over 20 years . I trust his advice with my health decisions . He has exceeded my expectations of any Doctor that I have encountered . He has found treatment that has been unconventional but proven to be successful for me . I travel from a different county to see him & will continue to do so wherever he goes . His staff is caring & empathetic. I have always left his office understanding all my options 
Dr. Mark Moradi,"Dr. Moradi is a wonderful Doctor. He is proficient and thorough. His work is stellar and impeccable. His bedside manner is exceptional. He is very caring, reassuring and doesn't rush. Dr. Moradi explains your diagnosis and answers any and all questions that you have. He makes sure that you understand everything. Dr. Moradi is genuinely concerned about your health and well being. He is meticulous and excellent with following up with test results phone calls, and appointments. His staff is great."
Dr. Mark Moradi,"Exceptionally caring physician, committed to his patients. I have been fortunate to have Dr. Moradi as a physician for almost a decade, he is very knowledgable in his field, thorough in his treatment and goes above and beyond his duties to ensure each patient get individual care from the moment you enter this office. Equally caring is his staff from the common courtesy follow up calls often not returned by other physician offices to the prompt scheduling of appointments. Exemplary physician"
Dr. Mark Moradi,"I've been with Dr Moradi over ten years and I find him to be excellent in his profession. He is knowledgeable, thorough, listens tentatively and stops to address each and every concern. He doesn't hesitate to take my phone call if a situation arises after my visit. I always leave his office feeling confident with the wealth of knowledge he has imparted in regards to my medical concern"
Dr. Mark Moradi,"I was amazed with the level of dedication, courtesy, knowledge, care, professional expertise and advice received by the doctor. He literally went out of his way to answer my questions and concerns. I would definitely recommend Dr.Moradi to everyone in my family. I've seen many doctors. This one is outstanding"
Dr. Matthew Lederman,"If you are suffering from complications due to Asherman's Syndrome then Dr. Lederman is not the right endocrinologist, find a more skilled professional"
Dr. Matthew Lederman,"I first visited Dr Lederman in 2014, after an ectopic pregnancy in 2012 and another year and a half of trying to conceive with no luck. With the help of RMA and IVF, our first son was born in Dec 2014. Due to the success of our first experience and our comfort with and confidence in the RMA team, we returned to Dr. LEDERMAN when we were trying for our second child, and again, with their help, our 2nd son was born in May of this year. We have nothing but good things to say about Dr Lederman"
Dr. Matthew Lederman,"I can't say enough good things about this doctor and this facility as a whole. I was a patient in the White Plains office and had some procedures at the NYC offices. The doctor and staff are caring, compassionate, organized, and helpful. They helped my husband and I navigate through the complicated process and fertility treatment. We are expecting your first child in September!!! I am sad to have to them."
Dr. Matthew Lederman,I cannot even express in words how wonderful Dr Lederman and his staff at RMA were to me during my pregnancy difficulty. He is brilliant and cares deeply for his patients. Fortunately I was successful at getting pregnant but for two years I struggled with real fertility issues and Dr Lederman kept me positive with realistic goals in mind. I cannot thank him and the staff at RMA enough for what they have done for my family. I deeply miss them
Dr. Matthew Lederman,"Doctor Lederman was wonderful. Great bedside manner, always pulling for us until the good news finally came! Highly Recommend."
Dr. Matthew Lederman,"I had been able to successfully get pregnant on my own before, but when it came time to try to get pregnant for a 3rd time I was having trouble. I can now say that after 3 medicated cycles, 3 IUIs and 1 round of IVF I am in my third trimester with a healthy baby girl. I am so thankful to Dr. Lederman. He was really the kindest and most honest doctor I have ever worked with. Going through infertility treatments is no picnic, but Dr. Lederman was there for me every step of the way. He really cares"
Dr. Matthew Lederman,"Dr. Lederman is exceptional. I saw him for IVF treatment & gave birth to my baby in June. While there are many, one of his most impressive characteristics is his level of knowledge and his desire to continue to expand his learning. I have a unique genetic disorder & when I met with him he made it his mission to learn about it & even joined a panel of medical and scientific professionals focused on researching the disorder I have. My confidence in Dr. Lederman is immeasurable"
Dr. Matthew Lederman,We are so thankful we found Dr. Lederman. We went through 3 rounds at two other clinics (both associated with top NYC hospitals) without any success before finding RMA. He explained our treatment to us and was extremely supportive from the first appointment until we 'graduated' to our OB. He was always available for a phone consultation between appointments and made a difficult process easier on us
Dr. Matthew Lederman,Dr. Lederman went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. He was knowledgable and patiently answered all of my questions during my visits. His staff is also amazing. I would highly recommend Dr. Lederman
Dr. Kenneth Levey,"If i could leave 0 Stars i would... My surgery was LAST AUGUST (2017) robotic assisted endometriosis removal. Dr. Levey knew I had a UTI from my pre-op appointment & never prescribed medicine. He told me while I was being prepped to go under, saying that the medicine would be ready immediately for pick up afterwards. He then operated on me WITH AN INFECTION. While in recovery, he left the hospital without signing discharge papers. The hospital staff was beyond angry claiming that he never"
Dr. Kenneth Levey,"Had to have an endometrial biopsy which I was dreading because of the horror stories. However when I expressed my fear he understood, gave me something to relax and a cervical block. Had slight cramp during the 30 sec procedure and some pink spotting. That was it. I also took 3 Motrin before but it was really nothing with the anesthetic.   Staff however should have called me to tell me he doesn't accept GHI any more.  Had Novasure procedure too in 2014 in office"
Dr. Kenneth Levey,"he did NOT any thing in my surgery, he just a greedy doctor. His invoice is so expensive and nothing was done by him, I had one surgery after him they found every thing as described in his MRI."
Dr. Kenneth Levey,"Arrogant, awful, money-grubbing doctor. If you want to read real reviews--and not the ones his staff makes up--visit Yelp"

Dr. Bernadith Russell,Dr. Russell is great! She is caring and warm. She is a good listener and love the fact she looks at your whole wellness taking into consideration whats happening in your life to your health.

Dr. Laxmi Baxi,"This is my third delivery and as a nurse, I can definitely say Dr. Baxi was the best OB. She went above and beyond for me and she surpass my expectation. She performed VBAC delivery and I must say she made me feel at ease during the delivery. She listens to your concerns and will give you feedback. She has great bedside manner which is hard to find nowadays."
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,I would like to recommend Dr Baxi to everyone. You can rely on her throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period for all decisions. She is very friendly and very patient in answering all your questions. She helps you handle all complications during the pregnancy with great ease. She makes sure that you and your baby reach home healthy and happy. I would have been happier if I could have her in my last pregnancy as well
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,"I couldn't have asked for a better dr for my first pregnancy. It was a pregnancy with complications but Dr. Baxi went out of her way to reassure me that it was a great pregnancy and that everything would be great. And she made sure it was. She was constantly in touch with me to check in on me, answering any, and all, questions promptly, telling me to come see her or call when I was feeling anxious. Her attention to my care was amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better dr."
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,"I have had nothing but positive experiences with Dr. Baxi. From the very first appointment till post delivery, she made me feel at ease. She’s like a mother to me. She’s very cheerful and friendly and she follows up with her patients even on holidays, even when she’s traveling or at anytime of the day. She gives personal attention to each patient addressing every single need or query. if we’re blessed to have another child, we definitely would go back to her."
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,"I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Baxi! She recently delivered my first baby. I felt confident going to her from the beginning of the pregnancy, given the online reviews and her decades of experience. She encouraged me to think positive thoughts throughout the pregnancy. She was pragmatic, never recommending any unnecessary interventions. She was generous with her time, in terms of responding to texts and committing to being available for the delivery. She always had my best interests at heart"
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,I never wrote a review for anyone or anything in my life but i cant stop myself to speak about Dr.Baxi. she is really an amazing doctor with lot of experience and patience to make her patients feel comfortable. Like other doctors i experienced before she is not a kind of person to do unnecessary procedures and medicines and trouble you in any way. I really love her like my mom. Now im 23weeks pregnant and all these days im visiting her with ultimate joy and happiness
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,"Had my first appointment with Dr Baxi today. I'm confident that I'm going to have a safe and a healthy pregnancy. Her years of experience shines through her counseling, she's extremely caring and thorough! Staff is very polite and were flexible enough to schedule my next appointment on a Sunday .... cannot wait to see her again ??God bless everyone"
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,"Dr Baxi is an excellent ObGyn! I am over 35 years old and just had my 1st baby with Dr Baxi as my OB. Firstly, she is ALWAYS available to answer any of my questions even via text. Secondly, once she takes you as a client, she commits to be available for your delivery! Thirdly, she will go the extra mile to ensure you don't get unnecessary medical procedures. I had a 33hr labor which started with my water breaking and Dr Baxi was patient to see me through a vaginal delivery with no perineum tear"
Dr. Laxmi Baxi,"Would not recommend. Though I had an appointment, I had to wait a long time before even being looked at by reception; when I finally reminded them I was there, they gave me so many forms it took another 20 min. They were so disorganized, there were 2 other urine samples in the bathroom; I am afraid she may have actually switched mine. Since finding out I have had certain conditions, I was promised a follow up appointment, but was never called, & had to call/email several times to get some help"
Dr. David Reichman,"If you are reading this review, you should go to see Dr Reichman. He and his team in Tribeca are all around wonderful. Currently I am 8 weeks pregnant on my first try of IVF there. He is meticulous, emphetathic and brilliant. I was able to see him in almost all the ultrasounds and he was very much available for my never ending questions through email. Becouse of him and Cornell I was able to go through this whole IVF process with ease and for that I am forever greateful"
Dr. David Reichman,"Dr. Reichman is the BEST Reproductive Endocrinologist! He's brilliant, patient and values his patients intuition. After 10 years of infertility and many doctors, he was the only one to figure it out! Patients in his care are lucky and blessed. He's a kind and genuine human being and is determined to be successful. The best, the best , the best. We thank god for him every single day"
Dr. David Reichman,"god sent, A for professionalism, dedication and results. after 2 failed cycles we have a healthy baby boy. it is not the success which makes me recommend him but the attitude and professionalism"
Dr. David Reichman,"My general physical recommended Dr. Reichman. It took a few months to get an appointment but it was well worth the wait. He is an excellent doctor, who puts his patients first and genuinely cares. He is funny, awesome bedside manner. He spends a lot of upfront time making sure you understand the process, risk considerations, cost factors. He personalizes decisions. He provides case study comparisons where appropriate to help with decision making. I cannot say enough good things about him"
Dr. David Reichman,"Dr Reichman belongs to a noble few that helped make my IVF seamless. He is brilliantly smart, empathetic, humble and spectacular. He is passionately interested with his patients treatment. He was patient and mindful that ensured fundamental concerns on health and cost. We were guided with right amount of information at right time to make good decisions. This was important to me as I look back in time, I wish not to regret. The outstanding is combination of intellectual and emotional intelligence"
Dr. David Reichman,"He is the best. A perfect balance of warmth, humor and the best professionalism. He is very intelligent and has a confidence that helps you get through the frustrations of the fertility treatments. Highly recommend."
Dr. David Reichman,"All the great reviews is the reason I went to Dr. Reichman, but I can honestly say he was NOT the doctor that helped me. Of course, we all have our own reasons for going to see Dr. Reichman, but he kind of 'blew me off' in a sense, thinking what I was experiencing was no big deal. I then went to another specialist, and she diagnosed and fixed my issue within 1 month. I think Dr. Reichman is a good doctor, but may not be everyones knight and shining armor."
Dr. David Reichman,"They don’t call him the baby whisperer for nothing. I wasted the entire last year of my 30s at RMA thru 1 failed IUI, 3 egg retrieval’s and 1 failed implantation. Dr. Reichman was a breath of fresh air and left no stone unturned to figure out how to set ourselves up for success. He worked with me to discuss STRATEGY and never let me give up. We welcomed a girl this winter at age 41. His practice is busy because he is the best."
Dr. David Reichman,"Dr. Reichman is the best. We worked with him through a tough time and then through a wonderful time. He was always responsive, helpful and kind. Highly recommend him."
Dr. David Reichman,"Dr. Reichman changed our lives. He is a caring, compassionate, knowledgeable and patient-focus doctor. I always felt like he had my best interest at heart and truly took the time to consider me as an individual. If you're looking for an RE and value someone who is responsive (HUGE factor for me with a million questions, concerns, etc.), he is your man. I feel lucky to have found him"
Dr. David Reichman,"Dr. Reichman is my favorite Dr. I went in as I wasn't getting my period and hoping to have a baby. During my first visit he had a good idea of what was going on and set an action plan. Two months later I was pregnant! He is smart, compassionate and extremely professional while still being fun. If you are remotely considering going to an RE, save yourself the research time and go to Dr. Reichman. Just keep in mind they are super busy! But it's because he is the best"
Dr. David Reichman,"Dr. Reichman is a wonderful, caring professional who changed our lives by making our dream of having a child come true after years of infertility & dealing with other practices that care more about numbers than about patients. I appreciated his honesty, sense of humor, proactive approach to treatment & how much he cares for patients-he emailed & called me personally many times to respond to questions. His staff is friendly, responsive & helped with insurance issues. I highly recommend him"
Dr. David Reichman,"For 2 years I was in hands of doctors who made me feel miserable without hope that I'll ever get pregnant. Then someone recommend Dr Reichman. He would always answer all my questions, listened.... within 8 months I got pregnant and just gave birth to my son. I'm extremely thankful to Dr Reichman"
Dr. David Reichman,"Dr. Reichman is simply the best. If you want an expert who is kind, dedicated and incredibly knowledgeable, look no further."
Dr. Kathryn Keaty,"Dr. Keaty is by far the most amazing doctor I've encountered. She is warm and friendly, but above all she took the time to listen to my concerns and thoughtfully reviewed all options for my treatment. I can't imagine finding another doctor like her in NYC. I look forward to seeing Dr. Keaty during my pregnancy and would strongly recommend her to any of my family and friends"
Dr. Kathryn Keaty,"Dr. Keaty was terrible. She not only misdiagnosed my condition she provided me with a pharmaceutical without any instruction for how to use it. The front desk messed up my appointment twice and I was left waiting in the exam room for over an hour. She was ignorant, irresponsible and quite honestly painful, as she did not appropriately numb me before taking an unnecessary biopsy. I would not recommend her"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"The greatest physician you can hope to seek care from is one who is passionate about their craft, the definition of Dr. Antoine. Providing quality care, genuine concern and a personality that would make you want to schedule an appointment just for him to make you smile. I recommend Dr. Antoine for a first time to fifth time mother he is Phenomenal and extermely professional, as is his entire staff"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"AN ANGEL UNDER THE NAME OF DR. ANTOINE!! it was my first baby and I had the most pleasurable experience!! Dr. Antoine is nice,caring and very proffesional"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"Dr. Antoine is one of the most caring and personable physicians around. His compassion cannot be overstated and the level of care he exercises with his patients is truly remarkable. In a world where doctors are not able to spend time with their patients he makes every effort to be available, to listen and explain when needed, and to reassure his patients throughout their treatment"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"Dr. Antoine has been my doctor for 27 years . He delivered all 4 of my children, all high risk pregnancies, all with complications. Today they are grown and Dr . Antoine treats my two daughters. Dr. Antoine personifies compassion. As a patient you are always treated as the whole person. He takes time to sit and listen to all your issues, concerns. He looks at the whole picture. I have referred many women, all praise Dr. Antoine’s compassion and care"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Antoine. He has been my OBGYN since 1987, when he cared for me during my pregnancy and delivered my child. At the time, cesarian section would have been considered by most doctors, but Dr. Antoine was able to deliver my daughter safely without it. He is accessible, conscientious, kind, competent, and devoted to his profession. As a medical doctor, myself, I can attest that he is one of those rare physicians who genuinely practices the art of medicine"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"I just started with Dr. Antoine. I have since recommended him to two friends. He is an outstanding doctor. He took so much time with me with very thoughtful and thorough questions. I was so impressed because many new doctors don’t take the time I used to get. I really appreciated him. I was very comfortable wth him and his wonderful staff. Just great. I feel I now have a great gynecologist. I totally recommend him. Excellent! Thank you, Dr. Antoine and staff!"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"Dr. Antoine has been my ob/gyn for 31 years and delivered my 14 year-old boy/girl twins. From the beginning until now, he was been nothing but patient, kind, gentle, thorough and calm. He is an expert at what he does - you cannot even see the scar from my caesarian section. I cannot recommend any doctor that I have had more highly that I do Dr. Antoine!"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"Dr. Antoine’s practice is very accurately named “Compassionate OB-GYN Care.” He takes his time with you. Both he and his staff are incredibly kind, helpful and responsive and eased me through my high-risk pregnancy with minimal anxiety. He performed an amazingly expert unplanned C-Section—both in terms of the speedy, almost painless recovery and the aesthetics of the incision—when my baby decided to come 2 months early in the middle of the night on a weekend. I cannot recommend him more highly"
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"My physician had retired due to ill health and I have been a patient of Dr Antoine for the past 2 years. I have known about him for a very long time.He belongs to a rare Breed of outstanding professionals, a 5 Star plus .His human qualities, kindness,understanding and a truly genteel demeanor with the charm reminiscent of a bygone epoch makes a difficult visit so much easier. thank you Dr Antoine sincerely, Brigitte R ."
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"Dr. Antoine is the absolute best. Kind, caring and knowledgeable. The most amazing doctor ever! He genuinely cares about his patients and is truly one of kind."
Dr. Clarel Antoine,Dr Antoine is the most caring kind high risk knowledgeable dr He delivered four of my babies Each one different then the next and yet dr Antoine made the delivery and afterbirth something that I have such fond memories of. My husband can not be there for many of my appointments and we are just so confident when we are under dr Antoine’s care Dr Antoine is not just a dr he’s part of our family
Dr. Clarel Antoine,Dr Antoine is a top notch obstetrician. His classy and caring nature is what makes him superior to other doctors! He is sincere and really builds a relationship with you. You are not just a medical record number or chart but to Dr. Antoine you are a person with a heart. He is always smiling and is pleasant to be around. My friends and family always ask why I travel far or spend the extra money to see Dr. Antoinebecause there is no OB out there like him. He is a messengerof god with hands ofangel
Dr. Clarel Antoine,Dr. Antoine is Extremely dedicated and unusually caring
Dr. Clarel Antoine,"Compassionate-the name of the practice is what I would call Dr. Antioine. He cares completely for the patient, making me feel like I was his only 1. I went to him after I had my 1st 2 children via C-section. He helped me deliver my 3rd and now my 4th baby naturally. He is someone I trust to the fullest degree. By my 3rd delivery he was with me for 13 hours during labor. He is truly amazing"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"I really liked the Dr. Mann herself. She was patient with my questions and with me. But, I did wait over 2 hours to see her. Also, her staff is HORRIBLE. It's been three weeks since I have got blood work done and the results are still not up on the site. I called three times and the staff keeps giving me different answers or brushing me off. Did the loose my blood?? No one should have to wait this LONG for results. If I don't get an answer soon, I will not be returning to this office"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"I was referred to Dr.Mann by a friend and i love my experience with her so far. She is very thorough and is genuinely concerned about my concerns! I would not have another OBGYN as she is the best.Dr Mann is such a delight. She has a very calming & caring spirit. She’s through, she listens to you, & takes her time with you. I don’t feel like I’m just another number on her client/patient roster... she genuinely cares! Please dont care about the wait time if there is any, its totally worth seeing"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Dr. Mann as a doctor is fabulous. Totally hears you and gives clear opinion. Doesn't rush which may explain the long wait sometimes. Careful with the staff. They just hired a new scheduler - Maria who mostly does not answer the phone, when she does -puts you on hold for an hour and then takes another hour to find out an open appointment slot. Donna was awesome and seems like starting July - the staff has becomes a mess. Don't have enough good words for Dr Mann. She's one of the best in the area"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"No doubt she is one the best and down to earth professionals I have ever met. She took our case in middle of the tenure and handled everything very well. Also, she showed remarkable patience & care on the actual day. My wife felt very comfortable and it was like a piece of cake for us.I really appreciate her efforts and wish all the best."
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Very efficient, truly adorable, gives you ample time, listens to you, never rushes, and will never encourage to rush for a c section, if you want safe care for yourself and your baby she is the one, she is the best, highly recommended"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Best obgyn doctor I have ever seen, wonderful experience, highly recommended"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"I delivered in Nov-2017, and during my tenure Dr. Mann has been exceptional in every way from treatment to listening/answering patiently. Very friendly and considerate communication too. I would definitely recommend her. Thank you Dr"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"She is the best obgyn, highly knowledgeable, went to her for an infertility consultation and today i am a proud mom of two kids, its all because of her,, i am really indebted to her for the entire life.She is the best"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"I feel compelled to share the terrible experience I had with Dr Mann and her staff. I visited her twice- both times there were incorrect diagnosis and prescriptions. If I hadn't called to follow up in both cases, I would never have known. Dr Mann was not apologetic about the errors. It is clear Dr Mann and her practice are unorganized, rushed, and don't care for their clients individual needs"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"While I'm sure Dr Mann is as great as these reviews suggest, I wouldn't know, despite visiting both of her offices in less than a week. Last week - waited 2 hours, hadnt even filled out paperwork, and finally (politely) asked to reschedule. Tonight - showed up at 540 for my 630 appointment, left the waiting room at 830 in disbelief. DO NOT SCHEDULE ANYTHING WITH THIS DOCTOR! YOU WILL NOT SEE HER! Multiple people complained, and 3 women walked out in the 3 hours I waited."
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Dr Mann is absolutely amazing. The staff at the office in Saddle Brook is another story. They are very rude and unprofessional. It is almost impossible to speak with someone without being put on hold for 30+ minutes and they are down right mean. I deal with the staff issues for Dr. Mann. She is the best OBGYN I have ever been to. Kind, caring, knowledgeable and spends a lot of time with you if you need. Everything about her is great."
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Very nice doctor, i like the way she treats, she is very friendly to her patients, she listens to you, highly knowledgeable. I highly recommend her"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Best obgyn in the area, i would highly recommend her,i was told by many doctors that i have some fertility related issues and cannot get pregnant, i saw many obgyns, i would say she is the best, i followed her advice and the result is that i am 8 months pregnant now and will be giving birth to a baby boy soon, i am greatly indebted to her, she is like an angel to our small family, she is the best. never seen such a knowledgeable doctor like her"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Hi everyone,i am 6 months pregnant, thank the almighty god that i met Dr Mann,she is my obgyn, i am having the best experience with her , she is very nice, i feel comfortable seeing her, admire her bedside manners, i would highly recommend her, she is the best"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Beyond the excellence! Dr. Mann is far and away the best doctor I have ever met who listens to the patient and takes care of her with great attention. She is extremely intelligent, a compassionate and caring doctor, and a truly outstanding doctor. I am grateful to found Dr. Mann for my wife. She took care of my wife at the time of pregnancy which was complicated due to previous C-section. We strongly recommend her for OB GYN. Beyond from 5 Stars if they had them"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Best OB/GYN experience in life. Dr Mann is the best , she is an excellent doctor who listens to the patient, i feel myself and my unborn are in the safest hands, she devotes a lot of time to her patients, never rushes, i dont mind even if i have to wait to see her.She is the best"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"This was my first visit to Dr.Mann. A good friend highly recommended Dr.Mann. I was very please with the doctor's direct and thoughtful consideration of my concerns and health issues and her polite nature, she is highly educated with plenty of knowledge,she advised me about the do's and dont's when you are pregnant, which is very helpful, I look forward to continuing as a patient of Dr.Mann and would recommend my friends and families to come and see her"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"Best obgyn in jersey city area, very much down to earth, honest to her profession, explains everything, listens to the patient, never rushes, very sweet doctor, you will love to meet her for your visits, i totally agree why she has such wonderful reviews, as she totally deserves them"
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"I just moved to jersey city recently and was looking for an obgyn, my best friend recommended me to see Dr,Mann, i had an appointment with her yesterday in the jersey city office,i would like to take this opportunity to say that she is the best obgyn i have ever seen so far, she is very professional, very good bedside manner, and makes you feel comfortable,and the most important she listens to you patiently, i will recommend my friends and family to see Dr,Mann."
Dr. Manpreet Mann,"This is my second child and am so glad I found Dr,Mann. I just love this practice. Dr Mann really makes you feel like you're her only patient with his level of care and professionalism. I never have to wait long to see her and the nurses, phlebotomists and reception staff are all top notch.The staff and level of service provided far surpased our expectations. We felt thoroughly informed throughout the entire process and enjoyed the open dialouge we could have withDr.Mann. i love her"
Dr. Allison Boester,"Best healthcare experience I've ever had. I live in rural Montana where I have to drive 1.5 hours to a different town see my PCP (who also takes months to get into). HeyDoctor responded in less than 10 mins. It saved me so much time, money and hassle--but best of all, Dr. Levy is super knowledgeable and truly took the time to consider my symptoms and the best course of action. It was a perfect mix of convenient remote technology with genuine human care. Stoked to have found such a great option"
Dr. Allison Boester,"Completely amazing. Between the time, I opened the web page, until getting a text from the pharmacy that the prescription was ready was 24 minutes. Total cost for was $15!! The speed and convenience and friendless is just something out of this world. To get this done by normal means without insurance would of been a 3 week wait to get in to my dr, and a 2-3 hour wait to see him, and then $150 for them to say here you go. Healthcare in the US is BROKE, I am so glad this service exists!"

Dr. Navjot Ghotra,"Dr. Ghotra is just an amazing human being, very knowledgeable and very caring doctor. She is very supportive through my whole pregency. Specially she listens all my quarries patiently and resolve that problem. She is the best Dr. I ever meet in my life"
Dr. Navjot Ghotra,"This office is a JOKE. No matter how early your appointment is, you will be waiting at least an hour. The waiting room is dirty. Everything is dirty. The staff is unprofessional. Urine samples are taken in plastic drinking cups and left uncovered in the bathroom. Things that could easily be done over the phone (test results, birth control refills, etc.) require an appointment (so... waiting an hour and paying a copay.) Nobody answers the phone. It took me FOUR TRIES to finally get an answer."

Dr. Navjot Ghotra,"If there was more than 5 stars, I would go with that. We are so happy that Dr. Ghotra was my gynecologist and she helped us deliver our second baby that too on a day it was snowing pretty hard. My pregnancy had some complications, but Dr. Ghotra ensured my pregnancy was smooth and delivery was without any problem. I was able to reach her whenever I needed her. Though I am not planning the third baby, but I would suggest others to try Dr. Ghotra"

Dr. Andrew Defazio,"Dr Andrew is absolute best!! He always made me feel comfortable and calm during all of my appointments while pregnant and he was with me every step of the way during my long 32 hours of labor but I am SO thankful he was patience with me and waited it out so I could deliver vaginally! He was awesome during and between pushes, coaching me and encouraging me. I seriously cannot express how amazing he is and how thankful I am for him"
Dr. Andrew Defazio,Dr. ANDREW is the absolute best!!!. He has delivered 3 of my children. He has an excellent bedside manner and explains everything in a calm gentle way. I have moved from Brooklyn to long island to Florida and I still fly just to see him. I'd recommend him to anyone in need of his services without skipping a beat. To say I trust him whole heartedly is a understatement
Dr. Andrew Defazio,Dr. Andrew is patient and kind. He helped us through a difficult delivery (24 hours!) with calmness and expert follow-up care. I would recommend him highly
Dr. Andrew Defazio,"Dr Andrew is the best doctor ever! He delivered my daughter 7 years ago and I could never imagine going to another obgyn. I also have had some medical issues in the past and I am a hypochondriac , he makes me feel so comfortable and is just overall amazing"
Dr. Andrew Defazio,"Dr. I just started seeing Dr. Defazio and he is, hands down, the best obgyn I've ever been to (and I've been to a bunch). I made an appointment with him when I found out I was pregnant. My ultrasound showed a missed miscarriage, which was devastating for me. Dr. Defazio was compassionate, respectful, patient, and explained everything clearly and in detail, and answered all my questions. His staff is also amazing as is the prescription delivery service they use. I highly, highly recommend him"

I would definitely recommend Dr. Pinkusovich
Dr. Matvey Pinkusovich,I delivered my baby on September 19th with Dr. Pinkusovich. He is the best doctor!!! I had a very hard labor but he helped me a lot
Dr. Matvey Pinkusovich,"While i was giving birth dr. Pinkusovich was drinking coffee in the hallway, nurse helped me, my first labor, took me 26 hours, my baby had difficulty of breathing when she was born, also he asked me 1500$ cash money additional to my insurance, and when i said no, this is what he did, ailso i riped and he stiched me wrong did horrible job, made me ugly and i have health problems now. Horrible Dr. Dont go to him i swear"
Dr. Rachel Smerd,"Dr. Smerd has been my primary care doctor for several years. She always takes the time to listen to me when I come in, and if she doesn't have an answer to whatever's wrong, she's willing to be upfront about that and refer me to a specialist who can help. She's got a good bedside manner, and seems to genuinely care about her patients"
Dr. Rachel Smerd,"Dr. Smerd was friendly and patient, but the billing office is horrible. They double-billed me and would not help with insurance in the least. I ended up having to pay the full price out-of-pocket, which I have never done before"
Dr. Rachel Smerd,"Dr. Smerd is the best. She's smart, attentive and responsive to messages"
Dr. ILya Kleyn,I absolutely love this doctor and think he is a God send. Looks at things from a variety of angles. Makes me feel like I am more than a paycheck but a human worth the best of care.
Dr. Eugene Shostak,Great doctor. Very knowledgeable and responsive.
Dr. Eugene Shostak,"My sincere gratitude to Dr. Eugene Shostak, Dr Nell Eisenberg & their team of doctors. I was flown home to US from Hungary via medical team JETICU & to NY Presbyterian hospital. I was critically ill with pneumonia, fluid in my lungs , & more. Dr. Shostak took care of me from the time I was admitted until discharge. He & his team saved my life !! After he performed a Bronchoscopy, I improved quickly. Dr Shostak is a igifted physician. My family and I were very happy with the nursing care"
Dr. Eugene Shostak,Doctor finds special way to assist my need...great!
Dr. Eugene Shostak,"Dr Shostak's office actually made room for me quickly in their very busy clinical schedule soon after I was discharged from the hospital with pulmonary issues. I had no good plan from the hospital (not Dr. Shostak's hospital) upon discharge, in terms of what was going to be the direction of following up on my lung issues. So his accepting to evaluate me was a welcome relief, and he did follow up with more tests and labs to address why the condition developed, and follow up care."
Dr. Eugene Shostak,Dr. Shostak was very nice. He asked me what brought me in to see him. He was very patient and attentive. He's sending me for more testing and gave me a heads up on what it might be....which no other doctor seemed to be able to do. He also gave me different medication which is helping. I will definitely recommend him. One of the best doctors I've been to.
Dr. Eugene Shostak,"After the Broncoscoy, I felt much better. the pain in my chest disappeared the folowing day,( which i think was caused because the return of NSCLC). the bleeding from the broncospy turned less and less from the day of surgery to the folowing day. And on the folowing day, the bleeding stopped.-I didn't coughed up any more blood. Like the commercial about NY Prebyterian Hospital""Amazing things are happening here""....IT 's very true in my case of Broncoscopy performed by Dr. Shostak on 6/23/2017"
Dr. Eugene Shostak,"Took my Mom to Dr. Shostak for breathing issues. While the office is completely disorganized, Dr. Shostak is even more so. My mom had a bronchoscopy done and saw him at least 5 times, at which point he would come in to the examination room, without a file, a medical history, as if he'd never met my mother before, completely distracted and aloof. The office is run so inefficiently , and incompetently regarding test, locations, orders, prescriptions. Poor representation under the NYP umbrella."
Dr. Lawrence Wasser,"Dr wasser is a compassionate person checks thoroughly all aspects for his patients,great personality,good family man"
Dr. Luis Aybar,"This is the second doctor that I know - and I have seen many over the years - that has the patient's care at heart. Dr. Aybar takes his time to explain everything using words that the patient understands. He does not mind repeating the explanation if the patient does not get it the first time. He does not hide the truth but always finds a way to make the patient feel better. One leaves his office with renewed hopes. Dr. Aybar is very kind.  More than 500 characters are needed for this survey."
Dr. Arturo Constantiner,Great PCP!
Dr. Arturo Constantiner,i liked his way of treatement and fully satisfied. the wait time is very less and great officials
Dr. Michael Ford,Waited 2 months to get my husband in for an appointment . He was told to fast for 4 hours and get there 10 minutes prior to appointment time. He was 10 minutes late because of train issues like always in NYC. They turned him away and rescheduled him for another 2 months out. Best part is I WORK FOR CORNELL!!!!! They don't even respect there own fellow employees' family members. Never again
Dr. Chiti Parikh,"Excellent, as always. My health challenges have improved greatly since meeting Dr. Parikh. Thank you."
Dr. Chiti Parikh,Really listens. Has knowledgeable recommendations. Does thorough testing and then follows up with appropriate treatment.
Dr. Chiti Parikh,"I am so delighted to have found Dr. Parikh! I have been struggling for over 4 years with an assortment of symptoms and have seen more doctors in the last few years than in the whole of the rest of my life. She truly looks at the situation from a holistic standpoint. Why don't other doctors do this? She has an understanding of healing disciplines from both East and west. After learning the results of judicious testing, I am about to start treatment, and I am very hopeful. Dr Parikh is a gem!"
Dr. Chiti Parikh,Dr Parikh may be the best doctor I have ever worked with because of her her vast medical knowledge and Integrative approach to healing
Dr. Chiti Parikh,"I highly recommend Dr. Parikh to anyone suffering from a difficult to treat condition. She draws from Western and Eastern medicine which is rare and intelligent. She is a great listener and takes time to explain the treatment options, which are both “up to the minute “ and ancient approaches that are tried and true. She is an incredible healer. I feel really fortunate to be one of her patients."
Dr. Chiti Parikh,"Best Internal Medicine Doctor in NYC! I have already recommended her to my family, co-workers and friends."
Dr. Chiti Parikh,"Dr, Parikh is kind, understanding, patient and spends a considerable amount of time at each appointment. I never feel rushed and feel she is very knowledgeable. She has helped me a lot and offers a lot of tips for my wellbeing as challenges arise. It’s really amazing to be able to see a doctor who has a vast knowledge of eastern and integrated medicine that is covered by my insurance. Her affiliation with Weill Cornell is an added bonus"
Dr. Chiti Parikh,"I’m so glad I schedule an appointment with Dr. Parikh. She spent a good amount of time with me and was genuinely interested in learning about my medical history, hearing the questions I had as well as my health goals. She also took the time to help me better understand her recommendations. I look forward to working with her."
Dr. Chiti Parikh,Dr. Parikh is one of the brightest doctors I know! She is incredibly helpful and practical. She listens to the patients needs and provides an excellent diagnosis. I see her for all my general medicine needs. She has excellent bedside manner!
Dr. Ossama Samuel,Have been a patient of Dr Samuel for a long time. This last visit both he and his staff were very alarming about a situation that did not warrent it. His office staff actually dropped the ball on scheduling a simple procedure as well. Totally unacceptable.
Dr. Ossama Samuel,"Dr. Samuels has been my cardioligist for 20 years. I give him the highest rating possible. He is knowledgable, friendly and has great bedside mannors.. He has always made himself available to me when needed. I thank him and his staff and only wish that all my other doctors would be able to duplicate"
Dr. Ossama Samuel,"Dr Samuel was able to finally correct my high blood pressure took a long time because if side effects The cholesterol problem is still on he has no patience for side effects complaints, not fair to patient"
Dr. Leonard Reiffe,"I saw Dr. Reiffe as a walk in. I found him to be professional, knowledgeable and courteous. He impressed me with his knowledge of current studies on my medical issue. Because of that he had me feeling much better within six hours. Kudos also to City MD, I felt very sick that morning. I was in and out in under an hour. The staff was courteous, friendly and the facility was spotless plus there were lollipops"
Dr. Noel Smith,I recently visited Dr. Smith for my annual physical exam and was pleased with getting an appointment with short notice. He is very informative and able to teach while examining. I highly recommend seeing him. It may save your life
Dr. Noel Smith,"I have been Dr. Smith's patient for 10+ some years. I have had to see other doctors on the occasion when he was not immediately available, and would not want to have to change my doctor for any reason. Heis intelligent, caring, and he listens carefully to what you are telling him about your symptoms. He is an amazing person and physician"
Dr. Noel Smith,"Seeing Dr. Smith for almost a year now, having diabetes, high blood pressure, ow back pain. He switched my Diabetes medication to Farxiga, from Amaryl, and for the first time in abut 8 years, my blood sugar is the lowest it has ever been. I have lost over 40 lbs. (Farxiga suppresses your appetite), and since I lost so much weight, my BP is now normal, and I am no longer taking the BP meds. Now we are working on lowering the Diabetes Meds even more, by adding Bydureon, then working on my back"
Dr. Noel Smith,This is attempt 3 for me noe. I have been a patient of my friend and Doctor for over 3 years. If your a self fuelling pill popper who crystal like a bit cheaper when he does not get what he wants probably not going to be 2 good fit. If your looking for a loyal Doctor with ACCURATE diagnosis than look no further than Doc Smith. Please don't let the staff sway you from seeing this MN he works hard at his practice and more importantlyrics treats you with dignity ND respect. Hats off to doc.
Dr. Noel Smith,"No other doctor besides Dr. Smith (out of all the doctors I have seen) have been able to put me on the right medication. Thank to Dr. smith, he listens, cares, and has me fully functioning the way I should be."
Dr. Noel Smith,Dr Smith has provided consistently excellent care to my family and others for 15 plus years using high quality traditional/ holistic principles(Integrative medicine). Grandfather developed Temporal Arteritis (inflammation of head arteries) with blindness and physical deterioration on Steroids. Dr Smith detected/corrected the cause saving his vision and life. The strangely critcal previous post on this website is probably a resolvable communication issue with good care as we have gotten
Dr. Noel Smith,I would not recommend Dr. Smith. I do not think he is a competent doctor. He made mistakes and did not listen.
Dr. Mitchell Fishbach,"Highly recommend. Excellent, caring physician."
Dr. Mitchell Fishbach,"This doctor is caring, concerned, friendly and makes the visit free of anxiety even in stressful situations. I have and would continue to recommend him To anyone in need of cardiac care. He is never too busy to answer questions like so many others these days. I was in luck when he found me in a serious situation in the emergency room years ago."
Dr. Mitchell Fishbach,"I had went to see Dr. Fishbach in September 2016. I went in his office we spoke and then he examined me. I had the Echo cardiogram test performed at Lawrence /NY Presbyterian hospital the previous Friday. He was very nice, professional and I would recommend him to anyone that needs a cardiologist."
Dr. Mitchell Fishbach,I would recommend Dr. Fishbach because I find that he has an excellent bedside manner. He strikes me as a doctor that really cares about the well-being of his patients. His gentle manner is reassuring.
Dr. Nancy Mills,"Dr. Mills has been my oncologist for 14 years. She is the standard to which I hold every other physician with whom I deal. She is meticulous in her review of information and has never ignored a symptom or not followed a medical anomaly. I credit her with saving my life on more than one occasion. She goes way above and beyond the scope of an ordinary clinician, often calling after hours to review concerns about my condition. Top notch oncologist"
Dr. Nancy Mills,"I've been a patient of Dr. Mills since 2011 when she was at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and remain a patient of hers now at NY Presbyterian. She is extremely thorough and knowledgeable. She has always followed up with me if something was questionable or if I had contacted her. When I was going through chemo I actually received a call from her at 10:30PM on a Friday night to just give me some results from some tests I had earlier that day. She makes me feel that I am in very capable hands"
Dr. Nancy Mills,Dr Mills was exceptionally through and caring. We have never had a doctor who called after hours to share medical information or be sure we understood results of appointment.
Dr. David Goldberg,"Dr. Goldberg is a knowledgeable, caring doctor. He responds to messages and has great communication methods. We highly recommend this doctor. Many of our family members and friends highly recommend him as well. He is not your typical doctor that makes you feel rushed. DeMatteo family"
Dr. David Goldberg,Listened to my concerns and knowledgeable I never his area obviously- up to date with all new guidelines which is extremely reassuring. Answered all my questions and was caring about it
Dr. Yongjung Kim,Dr youngjung kim is a worthless surgeon.He has such a bad bedside manner. I was with him approximately for 11 minutes I timed it on my phone his assistant Connie is even worse than him he sends her in after he sees u and she had one foot out the door talking as she left.I MADE A BIG BIG MISTAKE GOING TO HIM I THINK CAUSE ITS MEDICARE OR THEY BOTH ARE JUST THAT BAD.I did have neck surgery after the hospital it got worse. So There are better drs with bedside.STAY AWAY OR U WILL REGRET

Dr. David Wellman,"Dr. Wellman is spectacular is all aspects, particularly his surgical ability and bedside manner. He has an amazing (and efficient) team as well (receptionists, assistants, nurses, radiology techs, etc). Dr. Wellman performed follow-up ankle surgery on me, and my recovery and return to function exceeded my expectations. If you look around the internet, you will find he has extremely high ratings. Believe them!"
Dr. David Wellman,Dr. Wellman is very personable and professional. He put me at ease with my surgery a tpf type 6. I experienced little to no pain after surgery and was reaching 110° rom by week 4.
Dr. David Wellman,"Dr. Wellman was fantastic. Judging from the results of my complicated surgery, he is an outstanding surgeon. He was caring and compassionate to me and to my children. I’m grateful to have had Dr. Wellman take care of me."
Dr. David Wellman,"David Wellman is simply an outstanding orthopedic trauma surgeon committed to excellence at every level. He is young, energetic and committed to developing his reputation and achieving long term superior patient care and results. Moreover, he accepts a wide range of health insurers. I am now ""back in the game"" and my knee joint, which was severely dislocated, is, pain free, fully functional and enables me to live my life as I seek to.....I am grateful...."
Dr. David Wellman,"In 9/2012, I sustained multiple injuries in a bicycling accident in NJ, including broken hip, broken pelvis, fractured clavicle, severe head trauma, etc. Thankfully, my family transferred me to Weill Cornell from a NJ hospital. I am very grateful to Dr. Wellman who operated on my clavicle and treated my hip and pelvis. I have full and excellent range of motion all around. He saved me from being lame unlike NJ dr. would've. Dr. Wellman is Excellent, Attentive & Kind. Now, my 5 year anniversary."
Dr. David Wellman,"Truly an amazing surgeon! If it was not for Dr. Wellman I am almost certain my father would never have been able to walk again. Dr. Wellman is kind, compassionate, patient, informative, and very professional. From the beginning, he provided outstanding quality of care that greatly surpassed my expectations. I cannot thank him enough for all he has done for us."
Dr. David Wellman,"Spectacular doctor; He is caring, responsive, empathetic and available when necessary. I smashed my hip on New Year Eve and he put it together again so that I could have hip replacement. His office is responsive and his PA, Ethan Jensen is superb. DR Wellman is the essence of a great doctor; skilled, listens well, responds and cares."
Dr. David Wellman,"Dr. Wellman is an awesome doctor. Very professional, kind, and thoughtful"
Dr. Gregg Rock,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DR. ROCK!! Thank you for making my feet look and feel wonderful. I had both bunions and hammertoes done this past January 2 weeks apart and never had pain and was back to my running by 6 weeks. Your lesser invasive techniques along with your time, compassion, emails and texts made my experience exceptional. As an OR nurse I have to stand all day and you took so much time explaining not just the benefits of this surgery but the risks and realistic expectations. THANK YOU"
Dr. Gregg Rock,"Marvelous experience. Ease of appointment. 2 feet 2 weeks apart. No pain whatsoever. Back to work after a week. Beautiful clinic for the surgery. Dr. Rock very kind, understanding and following through after the surgery. Totally approachable and available. And...perfect feet at the end barely a scar"
Dr. Gregg Rock,"Just a short note to thank you Dr. Gregg D Rock for your care and concern and professional manner in which you handled my situation with my toes on July 28, 2017. I am very grateful that I have met you. I came to you with a broken spirit and with no hope. During the six months that I've been seen by you, you and your wonderful staff have made me feel confident and secure. After having surgery you continue to check on me, calling me and texting me. There are no words to properly thank you for a"
Dr. Gregg Rock,"No professionalism , misdiagnosed my condition. Maybe he should switch careers"
Dr. Gregg Rock,"I can't say enough good things about Dr. Gregg Rock. My husband is a surgeon, so I was over-the-top picky about finding the right surgeon to address my bunions and hammertoes. After a year of searching for a talented, experienced surgeon whose career focused on treatment of hammertoes and bunions, I found Dr. Rock:the consummate professional (detail-oriented, direct, straight-shooter, compassionate), outside-the-box-thinker, incomparable diagnostician, ahead-of-the-curve/state-of-the-art doctor"
Dr. Gregg Rock,"I had a food surgery two month ago. What can I say about Dr. Rock...He is not just a doctor - he is magician. Firstly, I never had pain-not at the beginning, not at the end. Secondly, doctor was on text message with me twice a day. If you have any question, he is answering right away. Did you see this days many doctors like this? I did not! Besides his perfect ethical manners, he has hands of gold. Can't wait to operate my second foot. Thanks Dr. Rock, thanks from the bottom of my heart."
Dr. Gregg Rock,"My mother, 82 years old in excellent shape, after an internet search found Dr Rock for a foot problem. ( He said that what he could offer her was orthodics to align her spine, and took a mold of her feet.) After returning 2 weeks later to pick up the mold and insert them in her tennis shoes, she wore them and developed a limp from practically day to night. I cried that whole night. She now sways when she walks, and is trying to correct the problem developed by the orthodics, with a physiatrist."
Dr. Gregg Rock,"Dr. Greg Rock is the amazing!!! From the moment I met him I was very comfortable with having him do my procedure. He took his time to explain everything about my foot condition, the procedure and what to expect. Everything was as he explained it would be. The first 2 days after my surgery there was no pain at all. Later there was some minor aching but nothing that would require pain killers. 
 Dr. Rock texted me every day to check up on my recovery and answered any questions or concerns that I"
Dr. Gregg Rock,I am 66 years old female. Dr. Rock did bunion surgery on both my feet. First 2 days there was no pain at all. Later it was a little pain which did not require pain killers. Dr. Rock made everything easy and not scary at all. Dr. Rock texted me every day and answered all questions. The only thing I regret that I did not do it long time ago. But I DID NOT KNOW THIS GREAT DOCTOR before. dr. Rock and staff in his office and in surgical center are very professional and knowledgable.
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I was very pleased with my surgery & care with Dr. Shah. I had my knee surgery exactly a year ago in Oct. 2017. I walked out of the hospital the next day without a cane. His pre & post surgery care & staff were excellent & always followed up on any questions I asked or concerns in a prompt, caring & professional manner. As a general comment: Industry wide I do wish all medical procedures involving pain meds would be linked with personal counseling about their benefits, dangers"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr. Shah replaced my left hip (which also had a fractured femur) on Sept. 11, 2018. He and his team at Columbia Presbyterian did an outstanding job and as of 10/1 I am easily walking with a cane (and often for a block or so without it) and all with only a minor tightness in the new joint. By next month I should be back to my full schedule of swimming and dancing. Thank you again Dr. Shah, I will continue to highly recommend you. Sincerely, Robert E. O'Melia"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I would like to thank Dr. Shah for his excellent job . My total right knee replacement was successful. After a few days , with the help of the physical therapist who comes daily to our house , I can get up from bed by myself , walk using a cane and go up and down the eleven steps of our house. I can walk along the side walk a short distance from our house. I will continue having physical therapy in a PT facility and hopefully will be ready for the next surgery for my left knee ."
Dr. Roshan Shah,I thought Dr. Shah gave very clear advice when I considered and decided to move forward with a partial knee replacement. He took the time to try to understand my lifestyle and overall physical condition in helping me think things through.
Dr. Roshan Shah,Dr. Shah performed my total knee replacement July 2018. I initially saw him for a second opinion after seeing another very experienced NYC surgeon. Dr. Shah's focus and level of engagement with me as a patient was exceptional. He also offered me the option of a personalized knee built to my personal CT scan specifications. Surgery was flawless and recovery rapid. I feel confidant of less pain and greater function than prior surgery. Choosing Dr. Shah was one of my best decisions ever.
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr Shah is the consummate listener and proved his diagnostic skills through patience and testing. I am fortunate to be free of pain and he solved a problem that other specialists either denied existed, mis diagnosed, or were not comfortable treating."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Superb experience with a truly gifted surgeon who has scripted an operative plan that, when followed, makes the knee replacement procedure result so much better. Dr. Shah always takes you on time (important to me). The staff is conscientious and professional - reflecting Dr. Shah's approach to treating his patients. Can't recommend any higher"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr.Shah has replaced both of my hips. My experience of him is that he is exceptionally intelligent, precise, and technically skilled. He is also a uniquely warm and concerned human being with a capacity to relate to patients as people without violating his professional boundaries. I would refer him to anyone, especially my family and friends!"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"You absolutely can't go to anyone else. This man performed magic on my knee. He told me it would be painless and IT WAS ! I never needed any of those fancy pain pills and I was up walking the hall using a walker, a few hours after surgery. I went home the next day. In home physical therapy started right after that for two weeks and then the outpatient PT follows, for as long as needed. Dr Shah is pleasant, punctual and patient with any and all questions."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Roshan Shah. He is incredibly articulate, thoughtful and caring. He takes the time to explain and educate. His dedication to his specialty is as impressive as his training and education. My knee replacement experience with Dr. Shah went smoothly and the follow-up care was thorough. I would recommend Dr. Shah to anyone considering joint replacement surgery."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I wanted to write this review much earlier. All my family is EXTREMELY THANKFUL to Dr. Shah. He performed an amazing job for my mother's hip replacement on August 18 2017. My mom is 84 years old and we were afraid to do it, because of her age and heart condition. After meeting Dr.Shah at first appointment we felt very confident. He said that she will start walking next day after surgery and pain will be gone. And all this happened!!! Dr. Shah is very caring, knowledgeable and talented surgeon!"
Dr. Roshan Shah,I had 2 surgeries replacing my left and right hips. Now I am pain free and able to have full mobility dr Shah explained what to expect during and after my surgeries He was patient and encouraging. If you are having hip or knee pain make an appointment to see dr Shah he will really help you
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr. Shah performed a total knee replacement (TKR) surgery on me left leg. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the knee the next day - besides the incision it looked so healthy, not even bruised. The surgery went great, the recovery is going well. I am 83 y.o. and in 3 weeks after the surgery I am walking with the cane! It’s like a miracle! If you or your loved ones are in need of Orthopedic Surgeon Dr Shah is the best one!!! I am forever grateful to Dr. Shah and his great team"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr. Shah is an exceptional doctor, I've been under his care for almost a year and all I have to say is THANK YOU for giving me my life back! I had a knee replacement in January on my left leg and a half knee replacement in October on my right leg. What I love the most about Dr, Shah is his sensitivity & understanding towards me. Never once did I feel the pressure to rush into an operation without exploring and discussing all my options. Thank you again for my miracle."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I would recommend Dr. Shah for any orthopedic surgery. He is professional, straightforward, and thorough in explaining my current situation with me knees and recommendations. The surgery went great, and my recovery is coming along nicely."
Dr. Roshan Shah," was recommended to Dr Shah by my GP. I was in terrible hip pain. I met with Dr. Shah for the first time i think it was 6/18/17 or close to that, He schedualed me asap..8/4/17. now 6 weeks later and still a little sore but going back to work 8/18/17. I was very happy with Dr. Shah. I felt he knew what he was doing. At this point i would recommend him to anyone!!! ."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr. Shah performed a TKR of my (right) knee. Upon meeting him and learning he trained with top Chicago surgeon on ‘my list’ - I bit the bullet and let him perform the surgery. I am glad I went to Dr. Shah at Columbia. My scar is smaller (incision was glued – no stitches!) & pain was less than others I know who had the procedure. After limping for MANY years, I now walk with a normal gait. Dr. Shah has cutting edge techniques & personally follows up with his patients post-op. A rare find."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr. Shah and his team did a great job, exceeding all expectations. I was up and walking within ours of surgery and doing so with a walker or cane with a few days. I couldn't recommend him more."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"To ANYONE considering Total Knee Replacement, I strongly advise that you make an appointment with Dr. Roshan Shah! My name is Michael J. Ryan and I was very uncomfortable about having the surgery, even though I was going through years of excrusiating pain. After meeting with Dr. Shah, I was convinced that I had the right person to perform the surgery. On August 11, 2017 Dr. Shah performed the surgery and yesterday I had my first visit Post-Op and my knee is NOW at Ninety degrees and pain free"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"The experience I had with Dr Shah was absolutely wonderful , he made me feel like a real human being and was very caring, He explained to me all the procedures of my surgery in detail and what was going to happen after the surgery, I cannot be more happier than what I am after my surgery, if feels I wasted years of my life in pain , had I know that I would feel like a new person today , I would have had this surgery 2 years ago when it was first scheduled, Dr Shah is a compassionate surgeon"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I recently underwent a complete hip transplant with Dr Shah and his amazing team at Columbia Presbyterian hospital. I'd been suffering for years with severe pain from my hip, but I was to afraid to have the surgery needed to correct the problem. I was eventually advised to see Dr. shah, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life. Dr. Shah and his team, from start to finish were professional, kind and reassuring; completely calming my concerns. The surgery was quick and so was m"
Dr. Roshan Shah,Thank You Dr Shaw !!! Its a rainy day and I was thinking about how much pain I was in last year and how hard it was to tie my shoe.My new hip is working perfect. You gave me back the freedom to live a normal life without pain! I am a at risk patient with a enlarged heart. Dr Shaw was willing to help me and he will help you . I had been to 5 other doctors that would not operate on me. From the first meeting he was magnificent and now I am a new man!
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I am very grateful and happy with Dr. Shah. I went in for a hip replacement 2 years ago and I have had an incredible experience from the very first visit. He is very kind and attentive, any question i had he was more than willing to answer (and i had a lot of questions). He explained everything extremely well and i couldn't have asked for a better surgeon. My hip feels great, i have had no pain at all and it is just as great as ever. Thank you so much Dr. Shah."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"I was virtually immobile with bilateral hip necrosis when I came to Dr. Shah for a second opinion after 7 months of pain and surgery delays with my first Dr. Dr. Shah scheduled surgery immediately and replaced both hips. Now, after just one month of physical therapy I have left the wheelchair and walker behind and am walking with a cane only. My physical therapist attributed my fast recovery to Dr. Shah's skill. He was a godsend and I am so grateful. I would highly recommend Dr Shah to anyone."
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr. Shah is the best. He replaced both my hips, with six weeks in between surgeries. Didn't believe it could be done, but he is both a skilled surgeon and an attentive and caring person. I had managed to stave off surgery for 15 years, but Dr. Shah was quick to tell me when my time had come. And he was right. It's 3 weeks after the second surgery and I'm walking further and with less pain than I have in 2 years. I've had almost no pain post surgery"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"My experience with Dr. Shah has been phenomenal! A true godsend. I had a total knee replacement with Dr. Shah and the recovery has been unbelievably fast and with much less pain than I had anticipated, range of motion is excellent. This was my 9th bone surgery and not only was I skeptical (a few failed and painful surgeries) but I had prepared for the worse. Imagine my surprise when I was up and to the bathroom the same day as my surgery. The scar is thin and beautiful!"
Dr. Roshan Shah,"Dr. Shah was thorough and extremely thoughtful in his diagnosis and care when I became a patient in June 2016. I ultimately needed knee replacement surgery which took place in January 2017. Incredibly, I was able to return to work in just 3 weeks with the 2nd knee scheduled for March. All in all, it was a good experience with a better than expected outcome which I know was due to Dr. Shah and his team's expertise. I appreciate all their help, kindness and consideration"
Dr. Roshan Shah,For me you are the best orthopedic of the United States Of America and of the world. I was operated from my knee.I find myself okay.Thank you for your attention!Also thank you for everyone who assists him!For me you have more than 5 stars!Thank you so much see you soon!
Dr. David Mayman,"Excellent surgeon,great bedside manner well respected by staff. Considering I had both knees replaced one in 2016 and the other one year later Dr Mayman made me feel secure and unafraid.The surgery literally saved my life"
Dr. David Mayman,Had 2x knee replacement surgery with Dr. Mayman. Excellent outcomes. Pleasant and effective. Highest recommendation.
Dr. David Mayman,"I had Dr. Mayman do a left hip replacement, and both knees. He is an excellent dr , and would recommend him to anyone. I have referred him to a few people already. He is the best of the best!!"
Dr. David Mayman,Dr Mayman did my RTHR June 2017 & is doing my LTHR Dec 29th 2017...this Dr has so much compassion and concern for his patients! He took his time and answered every question and concern I had...I am in the best hands come my next hip replacement!! What a truly caring and attentive Dr I have chosen ! He makes it a truly worry free experience! TY Dr Mayman your compassion&personal concern are truly hard to find! You made me feel like family! I am so grateful I chose you
Dr. David Mayman,"Dr. Mayman and his staff were superb. Everything went like clockwork, everything was explained to me clearly and without patronizing, and I was back at work in under 3 weeks. As I write this ten weeks after my TKR, my knee feels better than it has in years."
Dr. David Mayman,It will soon be three years since my total knee replacement and I have absolutely no pain and am able to do everything. I am 74 years old and even won a gold medal in a 5K race for my age. Dr. Mayman thank you; you are the best
Dr. David Mayman,"After several surgeries on my left knee I could only bend my leg around 100 degrees. I went to see Dr Mayman to discuss my options to improve the amount of bend. He told me he averages around 40 degrees more bend per surgery, but could guarantee at least 15 degrees additional bend. On the day of the surgery he was surprised by the scarring on my knee, i realized he hadnt looked at it before then. It is now one year since the surgery, I have actually lost bend on my leg. Total waste of time!"
Dr. David Mayman,I had a knee replacement a year ago and the recovery and care were seamless. His bedside manner in addition to his excellent surgical capabilities are A-1. I have recommended him to many acquaintances and to anyone who asks. You will be in great hands and his staff was attentive and helpful.

Dr. Douglas Slaughter,Dr Slaughter explain several issues and treatment options.
Dr. Darren Lebl,"Fom my first contact, Dr Lebl impressed me as an ideal professional - knowledgeable, skillful, careful, patient and thorough in explaining my condition, my options and possible alleviations, and the risks and benefits of each. After I elected surgery, he - and his immediate office staff and then his surgical team - continued to reinforce my initial impressions, from surgery through aftercare. And I believe I had an ideal result from the surgery. I recommend him without reservation"
Dr. Darren Lebl,"I was extremely impressed with Dr. Darren Lebl’s consultation that I referred him to a friend of mine that was equally impressed. I addition, his office manager Ann Marie Asencio is a gem. Caring, courteous, compassionate and professional is the only way I can describe her. Anyone that needs their services are truly in safe hands. Rudy Martoni, Staten Island NY"
Dr. Darren Lebl,"Other doctors failed to mention the overall condition of my vertebral discs (which were younger than my age), despite the sequestered herniated fragment which was wrecking havoc on my life. Until my meeting with Dr. Lebl, I felt doomed to a life degenerative spinal breakdown. Dr. Lebl gave me hope, as he carefully took me through all of my imaging scans and laid out how surgery could help. Dr. Lebl removed the monster from my back and I am doing great. Dr. Lebl gave me back my life."
Dr. Darren Lebl,I was suffering from complete numbness in both hands and creeping numbness from my feet to my knees. Saw Dr Lebl who viewed mri diagnosed and patiently explained procedure and recovery time. I had ACDF on 3 levels of my neck. He was skilled attentive and accurate. Subsequent visits were timely and he continued to patiently answer all questions and explain X-rays taken each visit.Now hands legs and balance recovered. I would highly recommend Dr Lebl for any spinal problem.
Dr. Darren Lebl,Kind considerate compassionate & hands down the best back surgeon I have ever had.this was my 3rd back surgery.i would definitely recommend Dr Lebl & his staff any time.i also would like to say thank you to his office staff & office manager Ann Marie asencio.best hospital.best everything.dr.lebl is as my parents use to say god.thank you dr.lebl for relieving my excruciating pain.
Dr. Darren Lebl,"While I could not stand or walk without pain prior to my surgery, my ultimate goal was not just to be pain free but, being a tennis player, to get back on the courts. So after ""graduating"" from physical therapy and continuing to do 15 minutes of stretching each morning, I started hitting with a pro, and using the ball machine, 6 months after dual fusion surgery. In addition to no pain standing/walking for hours, I'm back playing competitively without pain. Thank you Dr. Lebl."
Dr. Darren Lebl,"Dr Lebl is a great surgeon. I had been to several doctors for chronic neck,arm and hand pain as well as loss of the deltoid muscle of my right shoulder. Since I also have motor neuron disease every other doctor I had seen either chalked it up to that or were terrified to touch me. Dr. Lebl was the only doctor smart enough and brave enough to help me. He performed a two level discectomy with fusion (acdf) several weeks ago and I am doing very well. I highly recommend him and wish I had more room"
Dr. Darren Lebl,"Dr Darren Lebl is a great blessing that I am endlessly thankful for. For Dr Lebl’s surgical expertise, for his diagnostic precision, and for his compassionate care, I am ever grateful! He explains your conditions and the options and goals of each step of the surgical procedure in full clarity. Detailing the necessary procedures to regain functionality. Using your MRIS and radiological images to illustrate a thorough understanding of treatment and healing pre surgery through post recovery"
Dr. Darren Lebl,"professional, in depth pre-operative evaluation"
Dr. Darren Lebl,ble removed a larger than normal synovial cyst. He and his staff were all very pleasant and extremely efficient. I have no hesitation in recommending him or HSS.
Dr. Darren Lebl,Great results have all the feeling back in my extremity’s Back to doing 3 mile walks Professional staff and wonderful caring surgeon The BEST
Dr. Darren Lebl,"After an emergency disc rupture, Dr Lebl gracefully found a way to get me on the surgical schedule as an emergency add-on procedure. He had me out of the OR by the evening. I was then out of the hospital in about two days, and after almost a year I've seen a full recovery. If it weren't for Dr. Lebl, and if I didn't have a skilled surgeon familiar with my condition willing to operate on me in less than 24 hours, I probably wouldn't be walking normally today and my life would never be the same"
Dr. Darren Lebl,"Dr. Lebl operated on my lower back, I could barely walk when I went in his office the first time. After three days in the hospital I was walking the day after surgery ( pain free ). Dr. Lebl did an amazing surgery for me, I would highly recommend him for back surgery. Thank you so much Dr. Lebl. Gene Gillen"
Dr. Darren Lebl,"Have not had a proced. yet, consid. pros & cons. I am compelled to describe the visit. Thorough paper questionaire 25 + page to depict history. mri, cat scan, and x ray. all 3 before he saw me. Precision coord. by staff. email of itinerary before arrival. Personal exam by Dr Lebl. Shared he needs to review imaging results in detail & compare against exam. 20 min later, 1st recorded diag. Then, in detail shared whats wrong & can fix. Only dr. ever to diag. me. Recomm. highly. Trust him completely"
Dr. Darren Lebl,I had very bad spinal stenosis. I couldn't walk without sitting to rest every few steps. Standing up was even worse. After my consultation with Dr. Lebl he told me I would feel the best after a laminectomy. I had the surgery in July of 2017. After surgery I started walking to help me recover from the operation. Two weeks after surgery I returned to work. The pain is completely gone. I can now walk for 30 minutes without resting or sitting. Dr. Lebl gave me my life back. Thank you.
Dr. Steven Schiebert,Great information that is very helpful for my issues. Will recommend.
Dr. Steven Schiebert,"I was able to ask all questions, no matter how obscure - and was very comfortable with answers received. Very patient and this made for a very positive experience!"

Dr. Steven Schiebert,Answered all my questions and explained everything to me clearly.
Dr. Steven Schiebert,"Great doctor! Listened to my concerns and problems, and actively wanted to help me and give me a solid treatment plan."
Dr. David Levine,This physician refuses to speak to physicians when they want to refer patients. His staff gives you the run around and lies and says that they will have the doctor call their primary care doctor when he has no interest in doing so. He obviously only cares about the money and not patients.
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"Dr. Gomoll is a fantastic surgeon, nothing but great things to say! He and the entirety of HSS was the right choice for my surgery. He is incredibly knowledgeable, personable, and caring, and left me feeling confident in my decision to choose him after every conversation we had."
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,Several months ago I made an appointment with Dr. Gomoll to determine if I was a candidate for Stem Cell Therapy. A day prior to my appointment I called the office and was told the Doctor would be at a conference on so my appointment was cancelled. Lisa promised me that she and/or the PA would contact me to discuss another option but I never heard from anyone and still have not 2 weeks later! I can accept that there was a mix up with scheduling but no return call is unacceptable.
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,"I have been a patient of Dr. Gomoll for over 10 years and the only negative thing I have to say is that he is leaving MA to move to NY. He is a Doctor unlike any other I have had the chance to meet. Over the years I have spent countless hours talking about my knee with Dr. G and I don't have a bad thing to say. He is patient and kind, not to mention talented. He both takes the time to listen and explain things. I am sad to see him leave and NY is very lucky to have him."
Dr. Andreas Gomoll,14 months ago my daughter had surgery for a frayed miniscus. During the initial surgery her first surgeon found significantly more damage and had the foresight to stop and refer us to Dr. G. He met with us and suggested a course to allow my daughter to continue her athletics. He was positive and thorough. A year later she worked hard and has recovered well resuming all her activities. I highly recommend Dr. Gomoll
Dr. Stephen Silver,Dr.Stephen g. Silver performed surgery on my rotator cuff and saved my arm and shoulder. He did an excellent job and his staff and surgery associates were all wonderful. excellent surgeon.I would Highly recommend him to my family and friends!
Dr. Stephen Silver,Dr. Silver is very skilled and extremely professional I would highly recommend him to anyone.
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr. Silver performed arthroscopic surgery on my left shoulder to reattach the labrum and a tendon, remove a bone spur and other repairs. The surgery went extremely well. Dr.Silver did a fantastic job. Now my left shoulder is free of pain and the range of mobility is like it was 20 years ago. I strongly recommend Dr. Silver to anyone that needs orthopedic surgery."
Dr. Stephen Silver,Great experience was very happy with my results it has been 7 weeks and I am already lifted weight lightly. Was very important to me to go back to my activity.Dr.Silver did what he said put me back together.Was in horrible pain for years if I knew it would be like this I would have had it done years ago.Staff was great . So satisfied I am waiting to do my left .Words can not explain how great he was .Thank you Dr. Silver.
Dr. Stephen Silver,Dr Silver operated on my shoulder and my knee. He is patient and caring and takes the time to explain things in plain English. He answered my questions and made me feel comfortable about both procedures. I had rotator cuff surgery on my shoulder and meniscus repair on my knee. My treatment was excellent and I highly recommend him.
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr. Silver did an amazing job arthroscopically shaving off a large sharp hook shaped bone spur and repairing a fully torn rotator cuff, 2 torn muscles and a floating tendon .5 months ago. I had very little pain following surgery and had full range of motion within three months of surgery. I can even zip up a dress by myself! I'm currently working to rebuild strength and endurance, hoping to resume my full exercise routine including push-ups in a few more months."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Saw Dr. Silver for diagnosis of multiple shoulder issues. He suspected a labrum tear from my symptom and I received an MRI that confirmed it. Surgery booked within a month and 7 months later am thrilled with results. Wonderful surgeon with a great demeanor. Love Vivian, his office manager as well."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I highly recommend Dr. Silver for any patient with an AC Joint separation requiring surgery. Dr. Silver and his staff are professional, they make you comfortable, and they take pride in their work. If your healthcare coverage gives you the option, I strongly recommend going to the Vanguard Surgical Center in NJ where Dr. Silver operates. Their facility is state of the art and his surgery team was remarkable! Dr. Silver is the best in the business!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I tore the tendon in my shoulder a year ago and I was told by two Doctors that there is nothing they can do. I found Dr. Silver and he was able to make the repair which changed my life since I am an active individual. The day after the surgery, Dr. Silver called me to see how I was doing and gave me some recommendations on what I should be doing. Dr. Silver = Dr. Good News !! He also has an amazing staff that will ensure a smooth process!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I had a knee scope performed by Dr. Silver on 12/14/16 to remove meniscus tear. The procedure was quick, it was performed at a great surgical center in NJ, Vanguard. It has been less than 24 hours and I already removed the bandage. I have very little swelling and almost no pain in the knee. Dr. Silver and the staff at his facility were amazing!! I hope not to have any more knee surgeries, but if I need one, I will most definitely go back to Dr. Silver. Thank you sir for taking great care of me!!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I have had to have two surgeries over the past year,on my right biceps tendon (ruptured at the elbow) and my left rotator cuff (torn). Both surgeries were completely successful from my point of view. Right arm is fine and my left arm can reach over my head ,which may not sound like much, but from not being able to lift it all-it represents a steady climb to full mobility (surgery was 4 months ago). Dr. Silver is professional and I would recommend him to any of my family or friends."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I can't say enough great things about Dr Silver, his staff, the office, and everyone involved! Dr. Silver establishes rapport easily and made me feel comfortable and in great hands from my initial appointment! His office staff was amazing as far as handling scheduling of surgery and acquiring test results. My surgery was flawless and my recovery went great! One of my best medical decisions was to be placed in his care!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I have lived with shoulder pain for 15 years. And then I met Dr. Stephen G. Silver and scheduled surgery. My bicep tendon was shredded, had significant bone spurs, multi tears, arthritis etc. Amazingly I had zero pain following the surgery. The recovery has been relatively easy. I credit Dr. Silver for his meticulous work. He’s also warm, inviting and shows he cares. He is a master at his craft. I couldn’t recommend him and Vanguard Surgical Center more enthusiastically."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr. Silver is an excellent surgeon who I would highly recommend to those needing knee or shoulder surgery. Unfortunately, his receptionist, Esmyrna is extremely rude. She doesn't return calls and her follow-up is awful. I had to call her numerous times to get her to simply fax a form to my insurance company. She is abrasive and curt and clearly doesn't belong in a healthcare setting. Its unfortunate that such a nice doctor could have such an unpleasant person representing him and his practice."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I recently had a bone spur removed from my shoulder and repair on my rotator cuff. Dr. Silver did an excellent job in explaining the process and the benefits of the surgery. His staff is courteous and helpful. Had the surgery done in mid-April, and am currently in physical therapy."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr. Silver's staff was very dedicated to scheduling a quick and smooth appointment for my knee consultations. I had knee surgeries, less than one year apart from each other, on both knees, and the recovery time was freakishly quick. Dr. Silver's bedside manner was excellent and he was very direct and honest. I loved that he wasn't so quick to tell me surgery needed to happen ASAP, but he gave me options and educated suggestions. Seamless surgery both times, and I'd recommend him to anyone."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I had a shoulder replacement done by Dr. Silver and the result is fantastic. No more pain, and I am back playing golf. Dr. Silver and his staff are extremely professional, and I highly recommend him for this procedure."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Dr Silver did a subacromial decompression surgery on my shoulder two weeks ago. Making appointments was easy (with quick availability), his staff is polite and professional, and he is thorough and able to explain things well in plain English. The procedure went as he expected/explained, and my recovery has gone exactly as he said it likely would. The Vanguard surgery center at which he did my procedure is very nice, with great staff. I would highly recommend him!"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Just a friendly, direct manner. Rather than tell a patient what they want to hear (me!), he told me in a nice way what i needed to hear. He was careful about under-promising and over-delivering. My shoulder surgery turned out to me more complex than normal (says my daughter, who's studying to be a orthopedic surgeon, and with whom Silver shared all pictures at my request). In spite of that, progress (seven weeks today) has been excellent, much appreciated."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I had two ligaments (PCL, MCL) torn. Within 5 weeks after the injury, Dr. Silver operated on my knee. The operation took around two hours. It has been pleasant experience. Now, it has been around 6 weeks, I feel my knee is pretty strong. Everything feels so great! My daughter had ACL surgery operated by Dr. Silver two year ago. And she is happy with her knee, too. I will recommend to any of my family members."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"After years of neglect to a shoulder injury, I decided it was time to seek medical advice. Countless hours of researching doctors I decided to place my trust with Dr. Silver and couldn't be happier with my experience. Dr. Silver addressed my concerns immediately and provided detailed information regarding my shoulder issue, the procedure and post operation follow through with him as well as PT. Professional staff and very clean office. I am very pleased with my experience."
Dr. Stephen Silver,The best experience I ever had with a doctor. He took his time to explain in details and did not rush me off his office like other doctors have.
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I was told by two other Doctors that my condition was too complex for them to perform, I was referred to Dr. Stephen Silver by one of the other doctors. Dr Stephen Silver and his team performed an intense 6 hour surgery: they repaired my Labrum, performed a bone graft and implanted a head implant in my shoulder. After surgery Dr Stephen Silver called me personally the next day to see how I was feeling. A year of therapy later I have full use of my shoulder. Thank You Dr. Silver and staff."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Great doctor, great staff- what more can I saw"
Dr. Stephen Silver,"My 21-year-old son recently had his torn labrum repaired by Dr. Silver. Dr. Silver has years of experience performing shoulder surgery, so my son, husband and I felt very confident that he was the right doctor for the job. From our first consultation to the follow-up visit after the surgery, Dr. Silver was exceptional. He explained everything thoroughly before and after the procedure and my son was surprised at how much mobility he had within a week of the surgery. I highly recommend him."
Dr. Stephen Silver,He is the best! I don't remember which shoulder he fixed!!
Dr. Stephen Silver,"Great doctor! Great surgeon! Dr. Silver repaired a labral tear in my shoulder. Couldn't ask for a more thorough, knowledgeable & patient surgeon. He explains things in a clear & easy to understand manner that makes you feel comfortable at all times: office visits; pre-surgery; post surgery. Also note, his entire staff is incredibly helpful, friendly & knowledgeable. Dr. Silver & his staff have made shoulder surgery (not so fun) as easy & pleasant as possible. Highly recommend Dr. Silver."
Dr. Stephen Silver,"I would recommend Dr.Silver for many reasons. From our first visit he made my 16 year old son feel comfortable and at ease with the possibility of his upcoming surgery. He also was able to answer al of our questions in a clear way for all of us to understand. Lastly, the nurses and staff who work alongside him were terrific as well."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr. El-Gazzar is an amazing physician/surgeon. I met him over 4 years ago when I had a broken leg and ankle. 2 years later he performed a partial meniscus replacement on my knee. He is kind, caring, confident and knowledgeable. He has done a knee meniscus replacement on my son and seen my daughter for knee issues. The process for all procedures and after care went smoothly because he took the time to explain everything before and after. I would highly recommend Dr. El-Gazzar."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,Dr El Gazzar is a very meticulous and caring doctor.... He is very in tune to making his patients understand what your treatment can and will incur.... His staff is very patient friendly.... Don't be intimated to ask questions....
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,was very pleased with the entire experience and would highly recommend Dr. Elgazzar
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr. Elgazzar is one of the best in the world! He Was in-depth knowledge about my torn PCL. Within ONE day, I had approval from insurance, MRI script faxed to radiologist, and an appointment the NEXT day! I highly recommend Dr. elgazzr you want the best!"

Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr El-Gazzar is awesome, he is thoughtful and very caring. He is on point and give options talks to us like we are people. His staff is friendly, very helpful"
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Dr. El-Gazzar is the finest surgeon I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He took care of my son as a charity patient when he shattered his elbow. We were so lucky to have had him as Jesse's surgeon. He has a reputation for arrogance, but he has earned that right, because he's just that good. I unconditionally recommend him to your attention. I don't even care about the extended wait times to see him at the hospital... we were, after all, a charity case."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,I highly recommend Doctor El-Gazzer to all my friends and families. He is passionate and committed to each patient and makes sure he provides the best possible care.
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"I've been to many doctors over past years and I can safely say that this is the first time I was compelled to write a review. The doctor himself is very busy but he takes the time to explain everything until you feel comfortable with your diagnosis. Also Dr Elgazzar is NOT ""let's rush surgery"", surgery was the last resort after we tried all other options. The office is very modern and clean and the staff were pleasant and professional. I recommend him highly."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Great Professional. Very intelligent, and trust worthy. Not part of the big Business field of medicine. Really is concern with my well being and gets me back on track."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,Best experience!
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,He was very patient and sat with me to discuss what was wrong. Great quality of care and hospitality.
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,"Please do yourself a favor never go and see Dr El-Gazzar. I was made to wait 120 minutes before his assistant come and took a stock at my problem. 6 mins that's what he took to document my years old problem. Then comes Dr El-Gazzar, a self proclaimed super busy guy, not in mood to understand patient needs and problem. He spent 2 mins, yeah that's right 2 MINS, and went away. Then comes his assistant back again and gave me prescription and left the room. That's it the appointment was over."
Dr. Yaser El-Gazzar,Dr. El Gazzar is a wonderful dr. He us caring and his staff is wbderful. His wife Samia is hust as caring and takes time to talk and comfort pstients. I highly recommend this dr. Bernadette Berry
Dr. Howard Rose,"Dr. Rose is wonderful. I had rotator cuff surgery in 2015 and was amazed how great I felt day one. I heard so many horror stories about the surgery, but not with Dr. Rose, he is the best. I recently injured my knee and went to see Dr. Rose. Appt was easy to get with a pleasant staff member. Went back today for a follow up from my tests, that were just taken yesterday. Again the appt was easy to get and there was no wait, I never even sat, went right in. Talia was great as were all the staff."
Dr. Howard Rose,"I am three months post rotator cuff surgery. I am pain free and my arm is flexible. I can shoot hoops with my 7 year old grandson, open and close windows, carry packages and dress with ease. And, I haven’t even finished PT yet. I feel brand new again. A few years ago, I had a TKR with amazing results as well. Both times thanks to Dr. Rose. Aside from being a gifted orthopedic surgeon with the skill of a plastic surgeon. He is kind and caring. He gets the job done and done well! ????"

Dr. Howard Rose,"I was satisfied with Dr. Howard Rose, but as far as his staff and especially the billing department they are the worst I ever dealt with in any medical office. I went to see Dr. Rose for a knee injury, I saw him twice in 2 weeks. After about another 2 weeks, I got a call from the billing department telling me that they received a call from workers comp insurance company stating that my injury was now under review with workers comp and that Dr. Rose does not handle Worker comp insurance so I need"
Dr. Howard Rose,"I have used Dr. Rose for all my orthopedic needs for many year. In my opinion, he is amazing. I have also referred several family members and friends who have had knee replacements performed by Dr. Rose, all with success."
Dr. Howard Rose,Dr Rose is ok. Nothing special. He did my total knee replacement 9 months ago. Been giving me problems the last 2. His office was not courteous all the time. Go somewhere else. You can do better.
Dr. Howard Rose,"Dr Rose is a good surgeon but his staff is so bad that I can't recommend him. They are unprofessional, rude, mean, insensitive. They are bullies. His nurse practitioner is a the most unhappy, nasty, disrespectful witch I have come across in a medical setting. I have said all of this to the doctor. I very strongly think he will do nothing about it. I am sure he already knows."

I very strongly think he will do nothing about it. I am sure he already knows."
Dr. Howard Rose,"LI Office-Dr. Rose, talented & exceptionally gifted orthopedic surgeon; suggest he take a closer look at his office staff. Waiting for my mother provided several chances to observe how people are treated in the waiting room. First, look up & acknowledge when a patient is standing in front of you to check in; eye-contact would even be acceptable?. Staff is the first introduction to your office; should minimally be professionally & courteous. Observed too many times to be just an odd occurance."
Dr. Howard Rose,"DO NOT book an appointment with Dr. Rose. His medical skills are great, but his office staff (his family members) mistreat and denigrate their patients, make frequent mistakes, no customer service, dont return phone calls or emails, lie and may attack you. This happened to both me and my mom after being patients there for four years. This is absolutely the most incompetent and unprofessional practice I have ever experienced. I do not recommend him to anyone, seek competent care elsewhe"
Dr. Howard Rose,"Within 3 1/2 months I've had 2 meniscectomies performed by Dr Rose. He is a first rate physician & surgeon who is also kind, compassionate & patient. He takes the time to explain and answer all questions - his wonderful sense of humor a great asset!"
Dr. Howard Rose,The best. Did my hip surgery last week and he is just an amazing doctor. Great bedside manner.
Dr. Howard Rose,"Dr. Rose is a total professional.He explains everything in detail and is very easy to talk to. He performed total hip replacement on my right hip and within 5 weeks, I felt like new.He is an amazing surgeon who I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone."
Dr. Howard Rose,"Been a patient since 2010. I cannot begin to describe how fortunate I am to have found him. I am about to have my 3rd surgery with him. I would not even consider going anywhere else or using anyone different. There have been procedures, I've had, that were not in Dr Rose's scope. He made absolutely certain, that I got with the right Dr and followed up on everything. I don't know where he finds the time? He is unbelievably intelligent yet humble. Spends the time needed. Truly a gift from God."
Dr. Howard Rose,"He is the whole package? If I were to use professional sports as an analogy, not only would Dr. Rose be a leading scorer and all-star player in the big leagues - He'd be the captain of the championship team and the MVP. He possesses all the qualities you want in a surgeon, especially when dealing with complex and ambiguous injuries. He's smart, knowledgeable, and has a great sense of humor. He is a great listener, and shows that he cares about you by never rushing though anything."
Dr. William Levine,"Simply put, Dr. Levine and his team are terrific. For the past several years, I have been a patient for a shoulder injury. While I might indeed need surgery at some point in the future, Dr. Levine has successfully managed my case with non-surgical alternatives. He did perform successful shoulder surgery on my son as well. He is a first-class doctor and a very nice and caring human being. I would give him my highest recommendation."
Dr. William Levine,From start to finish I had full confidence in Dr. Levine and his staff. My questions and concerns were answered and addressed. The recovery and post op kept me at ease. I'm confident that the quality of care is directly connected to my speed of recovery.
Dr. William Levine,I would absolutely recommend Dr. Levine to anyone that needs an orthopedic surgeon. I am so happy I decided to get surgery myself and the recovery has brought me back to 100% if not even a little better.
Dr. William Levine,I would definitely recommend Dr. Levine to family and friends. Thanks for everything!
Dr. William Levine,Dr. Levine was a wonderful surgeon and I would highly recommend him.
Dr. William Levine,I have had 2 surgeries with Dr. Levine. I can't say enough wonderful things about him and his staff. They all made me feel at ease and much less fearful. I would highly recommend Dr. Levine to all family and friends. Thank you so much for your great care during a difficult time.
Dr. William Levine,Thanks so much to Dr Levine & team for helping me recover from my recent shoulder injury. The support during the surgery and recovery were amazing. I can't say enough positive things about the Dr Levine and I'm looking forward to a full recovery. I would highly recommend Dr Levine & team to anyone ! Thanks again!
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine was amazing. He made what I thought was going to be a scary experience very calming. He always gave me choices and made sure the decision I made was completely mine, never forcing his opinion on me. He never let me get ahead of myself with recovery and kept bringing me down to earth. I truly can't thank him enough. My shoulder is feeling great and I am starting to resume all my normal activities. His demeanor completely put me at ease and am so greatful I found him!"
Dr. William Levine,"When I first came to Dr. Levine's office, moving my shoulder/arm was extremely painful. The pain was restricting my ability to do daily activities. Dr. Levin and his crew did a complete shoulder replacement. I expected to have a great deal of pain but it was minimal! Today, a year later, I have full functioning of my shoulder with NO pain. I am delighted, and I have recommended Dr. Levine and his team to several friends - the experience was optimal!!"
Dr. William Levine,"On my first visit with Dr. Levine he answered all my questions, I never felt rushed,he spent more time with me than the other two doctors I saw combined . I had a full shoulder replacement and the surgery was very successful , Dr. Levine made me feel very comfortable and I would highly recommend anyone having shoulder surgery to pay him a visit."
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. William Levine is the best.. I didn't know what to expect when I was told I needed a total reversed shoulder replacement.. Dr. Levine explained what would be done, made me very comfortable and without hesitation or a second opinion, I knew he was the doctor to perform my surgery.. I am thrilled with my results and would recommend Dr. Levine in a heartbeat.."
Dr. William Levine,Fantastic - Both he and his staff!!!!
Dr. William Levine,"outstanding surgeon ,great pt.care and follow up."
Dr. William Levine,"For my first major surgery (bankart labrum repair), I could not have had a better experience. Dr. Levine and his staff were responsive with appointments and able to answer any question I had regarding the surgery and/or post-op appointments. The facilities that Dr. Levine uses through Columbia Health are also top notch."
Dr. William Levine,Dr. Levine diagnosed and repaired my torn rotator cuff (reattached supraspinatus). Recovery is coming along as expected.
Dr. William Levine,"Not only is Dr Levine an excellent surgeon, he is able to explain everything clearly at every step of the way. He set my expectations realistically and my entire experience from office visits to surgery was top notch. The office is one of the best run medical offices I have ever dealt with."
Dr. William Levine,"Very positive. Good result and generally pleasant interactions, especially during clinic visits. He was a bit curt in responding to some of my queries before the procedure on the day of the surgery (they were logistical, not medical, and had to do with when and where my wife should pick me up after the procedure -- he seemed annoyed by the question yet he was clearly very busy). Otherwise everything has been excellent and I would definitely return to him if I had a similar problem in the future."
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine was superb in not only explaining to myself and my family what exactly was wrong with me when no one else could, but also in totally fixing my knee and ensuring I could return to top shape."
Dr. William Levine,Dr Levine performed surgery on my left shoulder. It was a complete replacement. I have to say it has been a phenomenal experience with him. I feel great and have complete range of motion restored. His expertise and knowledge surpassed my expectations and his bed side manner is second to none. There is never a wait time to be seen at my appointments. I came to him for a second opinion and thank God that I chose him for surgery. I would recommend him to everyone I know.
Dr. William Levine,"The care I received from Dr. Levine and every member of his team was truly outstanding! From the immediate appointment to assess the options for my severed Achilles Tendon through the surgery and post operation care by Nurse Practitioner Renee Bloomfield, the medical attention and care was of the highest possible quality."
Dr. William Levine,"I simply can't thank Dr. Levine enough! His directness and courtesy considerably reduced my despair. His skill as a surgeon is reflected by the fact that my once dead left arm/shoulder (rotator cuff tear) now feels great! Frankly, it was an excellent experience in an otherwise awful time."
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine and his team were absolutely amazing throughout the whole process of my surgery. I was hit by a car while riding my bike, the impact fractured my clavicle, which required surgery. Dr. Levine called me at 10pm the night after the accident because he wanted to get me in for surgery that week. He and Columbia took such amazing care of me during the surgery and the whole post-op process. I am now fully healed and am back to work as a drummer, experiencing no pain as I perform each night!"
Dr. William Levine,"From the very first visit to the surgery to the last follow-up, Dr. Levine and his staff provided a level of care that I had never experienced before. My visits were consistently positive -- A high leveI of care and concern, thoroughness in treatment, etc. All of which led to a positive recovery and outcome. I highly recommend Dr. Levine."
Dr. William Levine,Dr. Levine did my right total shoulder replacement on 4/13/16 and my left total shoulder replacement 10/26/16. I had so much confidence in his skills as a surgeon that having the second surgery was a cinch! He always took his time in talking to me about my comfort and progress whether he was in his office or in my hospital room.I found him to be very professional as well as compassionate! His office staff was always very supportive to all my needs and requests.
Dr. William Levine,WOW. Dr. Levine's level of care has been tremendous. From the first appointment and diagnosis to the surgical procedure and aftercare I have only the highest praise for his skills and and concern for my recovery. The staff that supports him in both the Midtown and Englewood offices showed the same level of concern for me. My procedure went as planned with almost no post-op pain and the recovery has been quick and without complications. Kudos to Dr. Levine.
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine was absolutely spectacular! From my first visit, through the entire procedure, and almost a year's worth of post op he was caring, took time to explain, and most importantly did an outstanding job on my difficult shoulder surgery. I'd highly recommend him and consider myself very fortunate to have been under his care. Great Job Dr Levine! Thanks again."
Dr. William Levine,"My experience with Dr Levine and his staff was all around excellent. Dr Levine is warm, friendly and easy to talk to . He takes as much time needed to answer any questions. His entire staff including front the desk are friendly and helpful as well. The surgery on my broken elbow was a success and I am back to full use if not better than before! Anytime I had a concern about my elbow the office was able to fit me in right away to see the doctor. I would highly recommend Dr Levine and his staff"
Dr. William Levine,"Outstanding result - full range of motion in all directions, zero pain ever from surgical date to present (2 years), continue to gain strength (up to 2/3 of current opposite arm, continue t o build strength). Able to work with weights twice weekly, very good progress. Playing tennis regularly with no limitations, no problems with backhand or serves. No indication to me that I even have an implement. I would strongly recommend Dr. Levine to anyone who is considering shoulder surgery."
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine and his office has been so responsive, so caring and the result of his attention has been so successful for me. Everything in this office is done with excellence and care, indicating Dr. Levine's talent in the care of this patient, for sure. ."
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine came highly recommended for his surgical skills and this was the primary reason for choosing him. He was warm, friendly and cheerful during each of my appointments and always pleased with my progress...Again a testament to his surgical skills"
Dr. William Levine,"My experience with Dr. Levine was great. When I came to him with a broken arm he made the decision on how to proceed with my career in mind. I had some complications with the bone healing on its own so we eventually did surgery. This was my first surgery and he made me feel 100% safe. My arm and my scar have both recovered very nicely and I was back dancing in no time! He made me a Bionic Rockette, and I'm so grateful for his help!"
Dr. William Levine,"He might be a great surgeon if you can get past his rude bedside manner. I couldn't and went to Hospital for Special Surgery, which is a world-renowned institution with a skilled and caring staff."
Dr. William Levine,I originally saw Dr. Levine for a second opinion and came away with such a favorable opinion that I asked him to perform my shoulder surgery. Dr. Levine was very patient and never left the room until he had answered all of my questions. I did not feel rushed at all. I am very pleased with the outcome of my shoulder replacement and with the performance of the entire team.
Dr. William Levine,"Dr. Levine is a caring, knowledgeable doctor. He made me feel at ease from the start. Before and after my rotator cuff surgery, he explained the problem in easy to understand terms and what to expect afterwards. The colored photographs of the inside of my arm before and during the procedure are awesome! Dr. Levine is the best!"
Dr. William Levine,"I had rotator cuff surgery and the entire process of my care was great. At the doctors office starting at reception exceptionally nice especially Kinga. The RN Brooke and Mike were fantastic and very helpf. Nurse practitioner Rene and surgery schedule people all who helped me along the way, and of course my great surgeon Dr. William Levine Thank you!"
Dr. William Levine,"I waited 2 hours to see Dr. Levine. When he finally saw me, he did not apologize or even acknowledge the amount of time I had waited. He then proceeded to spend a minute or so examining my knee and diagnosed me in less than two minutes. He was out of the examination room in three minutes. Unbelieveable. When I told my physical therapist the diagnosis, she said it was basically meaningless. Oh, and his office failed to send a prescription to my pharmacy even after a reminder call. Awful."
Dr. William Levine,"Based on a referral from a friend, I called Dr. Levine's office after an accident. Even though he had never seen me before, Dr. Levine called me while he was out-of-town to set up a treatment plan. I was absolutely confident in the treatment plan that Dr. Levine laid out; and throughout treatment, which included surgery and physical therapy, Dr. Levine and his staff were wonderful. They provided clear, thorough information and were very responsive to my questions."
Dr. William Levine,Dr. Levine and his staff are amazing. Priorer to my surgey I had injections and did physical therapy. I thought my shoudler would never heal. After my surgey it felt like every day it got better. After 3.5 months I didnt even think about my shoulder anymore because it felt completely healed. Dr. Levine was extremely thorough and I highly reccommend him to anyone experiencing shoulder problems.
Dr. William Levine,I read all the literature I could find from a number of institutions before the operation to get some idea of what I could expect. Everything went far better than the literature indicated and thanks to perfect surgery and excellent physical therapy my recovery was about 2 months faster than estimated.
Dr. William Levine,Great doctor. I fractured my elbow before rotator cuff surgery but the doctor kept on the operation schedule and worked my physical therapy in to work on the fractured elbow and recovery from rotator surgery. The staff were very good about answering questions and giving guidance before and after surgery. Its six months after surgery and I'm 95% recovered. Expect full recovery in about six months.Was able to go to Cambodia and Thailand on vacation 3 months after surgery.
Dr. William Levine,"Dr Levine is an extremely personable and skilled physician. My shoulder is almost like new. I am so happy that Dr Levine was recommended to me. Thank you Dr Levine By the way, I especially liked the doctor's footwear for surgery.."

Dr. Robert Strauch,He saved my right arm after a major automobile accident

Dr. Robert Strauch,"when no other doctor wanted to take my case because it was too difficult, DR Robert Strauch came to my rescue . I injured my hand on a construction site fall of one story. I went to 4 different hand specialist and they all said it was beyond their expertise. Dr Robert Strauch was the one who took me in,explained the operation and condition of my hand. He took his time with me,never rushed and let me ask all the questions that I wanted. It turned out to be a six hour operation. i fully recover"
Dr. Robert Strauch,I had carpal tunnel syndrome requiring surgery. I would routinely get awakened at night with severe pain in my hand. Dr Strauch explained everything about the Carpal Tunnel and the surgery. He was very pleasant and caring. He personally called me on Sunday the day before the operation to reassure me and make sure I had no questions. After surgery I had no pain and the hand pain at night was gone. I did not even need 1Tylenol. 1 month later there is virtually no scar. He and Columbia were great !
Dr. Robert Strauch,Dr Strauch did a thorough exam on me and suggested a non surgical treatment which cured my trigger finger. I am delighted!
Dr. Robert Strauch,Fantastic doctor!
Dr. Robert Strauch,I would definitely recommend Dr Strauch. He really listened to me and recommended some hand therapy which has me feeling better already! His office was also a pleasure to deal with.
Dr. Robert Strauch,"This was a first time visit and was a surprisingly pleasant experience. The office staff and doctor's assistant were courteous and waiting room was nice. Dr. Strauch made me feel at ease, did what I felt was a thorough examination, asked a lot of questions, went over all the options and answered all my questions and concerns.

Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"What can be said. As the saying goes “action speaks louder than words”. Taking an elbow that was shattered into 13 splintered like pieces, and making it whole and functional in a 14 week period speaks for itself!!!! Dr. Seigerman’s surgical skills speak loud and clear . . . “THE BEST” The Institute for Hand & Arm Surgery entire team (nurses, office manager, etc.) contribute to the healing process by treating you like a person not a patient. Cheryl J"
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,So happy Dr. Seigerman was the on call Specialist when I broke my wrist. My experience from start to finish has been amazing. Thank you for providing such outstanding service!
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"I had the misfortune of breaking my humerus bone and was rushed to the emergency room where I had the good luck of meeting Dr.Siegerman; the specialist on call for these types of emergencys. p As soon as he came into the room to talk to me I knew I was in good hands. He is an extremely thoughtful, smart and kind Doctor and I highly recommend him."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,It is difficult to say enough good things about the treatment I received from Dr Sigerman. The decisions were made through an honest and open discussion of the situation and the options available to best address it. I can safely say that it was his skill in the end that ultimately made the decision for surgery the success that it has been for me.
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"Great positive experience under Dr Seigermans care. Clearly explained the options to save my finger and insure the best possible use of my finger again. During the operation Dr Seigerman, who has great bedside manner, decided to insert a pin and cast it to insure no movement and a speedy recovery. Dr Seigerman top notch staff shows all the respect, courtesy, support and help through a difficult experience. Thank you for saving my thumb! Highly recommend."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"I was recommended to Dr. Seigerman in September 2016 when I broke my elbow. After a visit to Overlook Emergency room I was told to follow up with an orthopedist. I asked for a recommendation and they gave me Dr. Seigerman's name. I needed physical therapy and he also offers that service in his office, but I was given the option of going wherever I wanted to. In February I needed surgery on my left arm and Dr. Seigerman did it for me. He is a great doctor, with wonderful bedside manner."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"Strange but true...I had injured my right wrist after a motorcycle class and was unable to play my classical piano music for stress relief. After having gone through emergency care I sought a professional for the lingering pain. Dr. Seigerman gave me two options for recovery and trusted him. We tried the non surgical then went the surgical route after the first option wasn't working. After the surgery the office has a therapy and cast making team. Fantastic experience, excellent and best Dr."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"Hey all, This is one professional individual with whom I strongly recommend a visit if you've got something ""off"" below the elbow. Beyond that, what I look for in health care providers is one who has a passion passion for their work. This fits him to the bill. Thanks Daniel."
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"My daughter, who has special needs, fractured her finger and required surgery. She was seen in Dr. Seigerman's office for a consultation immediately and surgery was scheduled without delay. From the moment we walked into the office, we knew we had made an excellent choice! Dr. Seigerman, along with his staff and therapists, are the most compassionate and professional people we have ever met. The surgery went very well and the prognosis for her finger is excellent! Thank you Dr. S.!!"

The doctor is, hard to find the right descriptive words, I'll try: genius, magician, unbelievably talented and knowledgeable, a true surgical artist, I could go on and on. Oh yes, and he is a great and caring guy. The aftercare I'm receiving from his rehab staff is the tops. Thank you Dr. Seigerman for giving me my arm back."

People were telling me they needed to stay out of work for 5 weeks. I am going back after 6 days. I am very happy with the results.
Dr. Daniel Seigerman,"Dr Seigerman was careful and precise with my son's hand injury. He was very knowledgable, but also open and easy to talk with. He's a wonderful doctor - and I felt very grateful to know that my son was receiving the best possible care."

Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Knowledgeable, caring, and detailed in surgical procedures, assessment, and rehabilitation."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Thorough and realistic with my recovery time/process. Excellent surgeon.
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"This doctor is more concerned about ""consensus"" with other doctors than helping patients. I brought in an MRI, the report read I had ""at least a high grade posterior tibial tendon tear"" and he wouldn't even open the MRI. I believe he only wants very easy cases at this point in his career. Very sad."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"He is very professional. He communicates in a gentle. slow easy to understand language and tone. He's very polite and respectful. He listens and resolves my concerns. He was able to get me back on my feet and doing the things a mother of 3 does in five months. My husband and I are very impress with his knowledge, techniques, bedside manners, and professionalism. Thank you so much."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Very knowledgeable doctor, but spends about 5 minutes with you. You feel rushed and the front office staff that check you in are as friendly as a wet mop. So not worth it"

Dr. Justin Greisberg,Dr. Greisberg is an excellent knowledgeable surgeon. He always was very patient in answering my questions. Highly recommended
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"I dreaded a foot operation and had been putting in off for years. Dr Griesberg and his staff made the whole process so smooth, comfortable and anxiety free.

Dr. Justin Greisberg,excellent caring competent doctor!
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg is an excellent knowledgeable surgeon. He operated on the torn tendon in my ankle and the results were great. During the whole surgery and recovery experience, Dr. Greisberg explained to me exactly what I would be experiencing and he was 100% correct. He never rushed me out of his examining room during my office visits. . He explained and listened and now a days that is very rare!! I highly recommend Dr. Greisberg! He's a great doctor and his staff was wonderful too!"
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg is one of those rare doctors who make you feel better as soon as they come into the room. He's been as good as he could possibly be for me, today and in the past."

Dr. Justin Greisberg,"Dr. Greisberg was recommended to me by a friend who been operated on by him and was very happy with proposed surgery and results.

I have been able to resume my normal activities as expected, and I believe the treatment which was not always the same opinion I had received from other doctors was the right one."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"he is a great doctor. i had gone thru a process that i have never being experience before. he helped me get back on track after the lisfranc injury (surgery / screws removal) i been feeling great. i read some reviews after the post removal, some people has been gone thru worse but with Doctor Greisberg, i didnt experience any pain whatsoever. its being great."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"My experience with Dr Greisberg was excellent. I would recommend him without reservation, both for his surgical skill and the clarity of his explanations."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,This is the 2nd time Dr. Greisberg has treated me for a torn achiles. I have found him knowledgeable and sensitive to my concerns. He shares his analysis and reasons for treatment in an open manner. I would highly recommend him.
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"I fell down stairs and broke my ankle in three places. After spending a night at a trauma center I was transferred to be treated by Dr. Greisberg and his team. My ankle was reset properly and I received superior care. My surgery was a challenge and four months later I am walking unassisted and back in a gym. I am grateful to Dr. Geisberg for his professionalism, accessibility, care and surgical skill. This team is with out a doubt the best in the city."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,"This doctor is incompetent, he misdiagnosed my condition making me waste 6 months of my life. He miscalculated the severity of my broken ankle and the condition I have with osteoporosis. He didn't schedule me for surgery and the broken ankle didn't heal. In six months my ankle had only healed 10%. I changed doctors, and had a competent doctor do the surgery, but still I had to suffer for 6 months before having the surgery."
Dr. Justin Greisberg,If only I could put more stars I would! Dr Greisberg is such an outstanding and caring Doctor; he surpassed all our expectations! His expertise and level of care are unique! He was so caring about my well being before during and after my surgery. He listens and accommodated to all my needs. And the results: thanks G-od outstanding! Everyone is impressed by the results and my physical therapist told me in his 35 years career he never saw such a well done surgery!
Dr. Justin Greisberg,Dr. Greisberg is amazing. He performed surgery on my ankle and it is stronger than ever. I no longer have the pain and discomfort that I previously experienced. I would definitely recommend Dr. Greisberg to others.
Dr. Steven Beldner,"Dr. Beldner recently operated on my wrist to remove a ganglion cyst. Dr. Beldner and his whole team are professional, accessible, and caring. When you are with him and his team, you have their undivided attention. On the day of my surgery, Dr. Beldner even called me that evening to check on how I was feeling. I have full confidence in Dr. Beldner and his team and offer my highest recommendation."
Dr. Steven Beldner,Dr Beldner is one of the finest drs out there. i had a broken a finger and he found after a thorough examination there was an underlying issue of a tumor. i recently had surgery and he made me feel well at ease. He even called me later to check on me. I’ve never had a dr do that before. He has also assembled a fine team that works for him and they are very professional. I wouldn’t trust anyone else other than Dr. Beldner to take care of me. You should too. I highly recommend Dr. Beldner!
Dr. Steven Beldner,"I've had two great experiences with Dr. Beldner. He performed surgery to remove a ganglion cyst from my wrist, and recently treated me for tendonitis in the wrist/thumb. Both times he was extremely knowledgeable, professional, and pleasant. He was thorough, took the time to explain to me exactly what the problem was, what he recommended for treatment, and the probability of different possible outcomes regarding my reaction to the treatment. I highly recommend him!"
Dr. Steven Beldner,Dr. Beldner recently performed carpal tunnel surgery on my hand and I have nothing but good words to say about him. When he explained the procedure to me he broke it down in layman terms so I understood completely what was going to happen. He was friendly and courteous as is his staff. I would highly recommend Dr. Beldner to anyone who needs hand surgery. He answered all my questions and was very patient. I did not feel rushed at all. He is an excellent doctor.
Dr. Steven Beldner,"Great Guy! Awesome surgeon! 2 months after tfcc surgery I was back gigging with my band! Can't ask for anything more. Before the surgery, he exhibited patience and care while exhausting all other alternatives before doing the surgery. I wish all Doctors were more like Dr Beldner! His staff is just super."

Before the surgery, he exhibited patience and care while exhausting all other alternatives before doing the surgery. I wish all Doctors were more like Dr Beldner! His staff is just super."
Dr. Steven Beldner,I broke a finger and the ER physician told me I would need a hand surgeon. My insurance carrier made a superb recommendation in Dr. Beldner. He is absolutely excellent in his skill. He has a wonderful bedside manner that puts the patient at ease. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Beldner
Dr. Steven Beldner,"I would highly recommend Dr. Steven Beldner. Hands down the best doctor I have seen to date! Dr. Beldner and his staff are highly competent, professional, and thorough.

I am forever grateful to Dr. Beldner and his staff. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!"
Dr. Steven Beldner,Great surgeon!! He once saved this pianist's pinky & let me keep tickling the ivories!
Dr. Steven Beldner,"The office is well organized and both the Dr. and his staff communicate well. I was first interviewed by his Physician Assistant and had x-rays taken in the office. I saw Dr. Beldner promptly. He already knew my concerns and had read the x-rays. He proceeded to ask additional questions and we fully discussed the diagnosis and my choices for various treatment options, downsides of each and likelihood of success. He treated me successfully in the office at that time. He is warm and caring."
Dr. Steven Beldner,"Great doctor and staff! Professional,sympathetic,thorough. Highly recommend!"

Dr. Steven Beldner,Dr. Beldner is an excellent hand surgeon. He explains the injury and treatment plans very clearly. He is techically excellent in the operating room. I am a physician and he treated my injury very effectively and got me back to work at full strength.

Dr. Steven Beldner,"Dr. Beldner is great--he's kind, gentle and explains things in an accessible way. He's clearly and expert and I immediately trusted him to make the best decisions for my care. I'd recommend him without reservations to anyone."
Dr. Steven Beldner,"Dr. Beldner has been my hand/wrist/elbow surgeon for close to 20 years following years of competitive gymnastics. His expertise has given me back the use of my hands, and his referrals for excellent physical therapy has made all the difference in the world. I cannot recommend him more. He doesn't just treat your hand, he treats you as his valuable patient"
Dr. Steven Beldner,"I could not give enough accolades to Dr. Beldner and his entire staff. He is an outstanding surgeon having operated on my deformed pinky recently. He described the entire procedure to me in detail at the first and spent a lot of time with me. After the surgery he was always available to me for any questions or worries even texting him at any time which is very rare for doctors. He is prompt, empathic, down to earth and very professional. I would recommend him highly to anyone and actually have a"
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,Frightening
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,"I was sent to him by three people but he terrified me when he told me that I needed an operation on four fingers or I would be “crippled” and he couldnt then help me. He made me a splint so uncomfortable that my hand, which didn’t hurt when I went to see him, began hurting terribly. I also asked to get a referral to pt but he said no. I got a second opinion from a more seasoned hand surgeon who told me that I am not nearly at the point of requiring surgery and that they were many Other options"
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,"Dr. Polatsch is not the best hand doctor/surgeon. He is the BEST of the best! Period. I had ""trigger finger"" symptoms and went to one of the best NYU Langone hand doctors whom I visited twice but my fingers continue to worsen. I decided to visit Dr. Polatsch and he did exactly the same procedure (injections) as the doctor at NYU Langone but slightly differently in terms of which spots of the fingers were injected. I took note of that and the difference with the NYU Langone treatment"
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,Dr. Polatsch and his staff were amazing. I broke my wrist in a lot of pieces. He was able to see me urgently and operate on me rather quickly. I am getting therapy now and I see how much better I am doing than some of the other patients at my therapist office who has surgery before me by other docs. I am so happy my internist recommended Dr. Polatsch. I highly recommend him for ANY wrist problem
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,"Staff, in particular PA and officer manager were rude"
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,"After having pain and being in splints on and off with both hands, I now have full use of both hands and am completely splint free. Dr. Polatsch first operated on me two years ago for a tennis elbow on left arm. This past June he operated on my right hand and elbow for three trigger fingers, a nerve pressing on the elbow and tennis elbow. I am so grateful to him for his kindness, professionalism, and for being such a fantastic surgeon. It is great to be pain free."
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,"What a sweetie! I have had several minor hand surgeries, which went smoothly. I absolutely trust him and his staff. People with hand problems would be crazy to see anyone else."
Dr. Daniel Polatsch,"I had a very good experience. Dr. Polatsch examined my finger and gave me information to make a decision between an injection or surgery. . He listened and answered all of my questions. He is knowledgeable and professional. He was patient and gave me time to make a decision. Someone from his office called me the day after surgery to see how I was feeliing and shortly after I responded, Dr. Polatsch called me to discuss. He has a very nice bedside manner and his staff is friendly and courteous."
Dr. Jonathan Stieber,"Dr. Stieber operated on me 2x, successfully in 2014 to treat a herniated disk, a bulging disk, & spinal stenosis. In 2016 due to aging & my spine's tendancy for spinal stenosis & bulging disks he performed surgery for L2-L3 laminectomy with TLIF, L5-S1 transfacet decompression with TLIF, and L2-S1 instrumentation. Doc once again did all he could to alleviate my discomfort. I'm a little stiff now but a daily dose of an NSAID relieves that. I consider him a very honest and skilled surgeon."
Dr. Jonathan Stieber,"This doctor is very unprofessional and mean in his patient relation. He disrespected, humiliated and dehumanized me all because of his staff incompetence and inability to their job at a timely manner that resulted in NYU cancelling my surgery booking. I have requested his office to schedule a pre- surgical appointment with NYU physician under my Workman's case, as I couldn't get it done with my PC. Next, Dr Steiber threw my case out, declined my numerous request for an appt to talk him."
Dr. Russel Huang,I had excruciating leg pain due to a herniated disc. I went to a few Doctors before deciding on Dr. Huang. It's now been five years since Dr. Huang performed my surgery and I can't be happier with the results. I am and have been pain free since the moment I woke up in recovery at HSS.
Dr. Russel Huang,I went to see Dr. Huang with my dad. My dad needs surgery for his back. I have never seen an doctor answer so many questions in my life. He was not at all dismissive and explained the procedure to my dad maybe 5 times. Although my dad was seen in the clinic it was still worth it. The only negative I would say is the waiting time as he sees patients only once a month in the clinic. Otherwise he is an amazing and gives a lot of respect to his patients.
Dr. Russel Huang,"Last week, as I was walking down the street, I saw Dr. Huang; this brought back feelings of disgust. I remember my appointment with him a couple years ago and how it was the worst experience I've had with any doctor. When I told Dr. Huang that I was in unbearable pain to the point where I wanted to die, he was extremely dismissive and obnoxious. What made the situation worse was that he was training a man and still showed no professionalism or concern. I wish I hadn't wasted my time and money"
Dr. Russel Huang,I had my 6th back surgery with Dr.Huang. I've seen quite a few doctors prior to him. That was my biggest mistake. Dr Huang explained to me what was about to happen. He truly put my mind at ease. I am so grateful for him his colleges & his staff. As long as I'm able to be treated by him he will continue to be my surgeon. If there were more space I'd type so many more comments about him. I can't say enough good things. Dr. Huang is an exceptional surgeon & again I'm extremely grateful
Dr. Russel Huang,Good doctor
Dr. Russel Huang,"Excellent Dr. Performed spinal fusion on my 12 year old daughter, and from the time she was diagnosed till after the surgery he was there every step of the way. I would not recommend anyone else"
Dr. Russel Huang,Still suffering
Dr. Russel Huang,Was this helpful?
Dr. Russel Huang,"My experience at Dr. Huang's office was excellent. He explained all procedures, was available via text messaging which made both pre and post op easier. Surgery went very well! Many thanks to Dr. Huang."
Dr. Russel Huang,DR HUANG SAVED MY LIFE AND GAVE ME BACK THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT I HAD BEFORE MY ACCIDENT.WHEN I FIRST MET HIM I KNEW I WOULD BE OK. I THINK THAT HE IS THE MOST CARING AND TALENTED SURGEON AND MAN IN THIS WORLD. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH WORDS TO THANK HIM FOR ALL HE HAS DONE FOR ME.
Dr. Edwin Su,"10 months after my hip replacement by Dr. Edwin Su, I can resume all activities including skiing!! Unbelievable quick recovery"
Dr. Edwin Su,I went for several opinions and I live in Philadelphia. I was young and found out about hip resurfacing and came to Dr. Su via a web site called surfacehippy.com that is great. Dr Su was fantastic I immediately felt confident that he could help me and he is caring and overall was outstanding I am a physician as well and he is a doctors doctor. The hospital was great too. I am almost 7 years out form my resurfacing and cannot recommend him highly enough 5 stars for sure!
Dr. Edwin Su,"Dr. Su changed my life! Seriously. Dr. Su, his associates and staff are all amazing people. And, everyone at HSS was fantastic. I had a hip re-surfacing 2 months ago. I was walking almost immediately after surgery and was only mildly uncomfortable...no real pain. Two months out and I feel amazing. I am singing their praises to anyone who will listen. My cousin in California needs hip surgery and I'm insisting she come to NYC, HSS and Dr. Su."
Dr. Edwin Su,"Surgeon skill and experience are the central considerations when having a hip resurfaced. Dr. Su's skill and experience are unsurpassed. I would not trust any other doctor to perform my resurfacing. I am five weeks out of surgery and have resumed all normal daily activities. I've been pain free from the moment I awoke after the procedure. My smooth recovery is largely a testament to his skill. If you're considering a hip resurfacing, make an appointment with Dr. Su. You'll be glad you did!"
Dr. Edwin Su,"Dr. Su is an amazing surgeon! I livein Charleston South Carolina and travelled to New York City to have Dr. Su do bilateral hip replacements. I am a physician myself and I knew that Dr. Su would do the best job possible for me. Just 2 weeks ago I had both hips done and my recovery has been a breeze. I know that it is the expertise of Dr. Su that is allowing me to have such a great recovery. Before my surgery, I could hardly walk and just after two weeks, I am walking city blocks."
Dr. Edwin Su,"I had my total hip replacement in October 2014, after over three years I can say without any hesitation that Dr.Edwin Su is a perfect example of a gifted surgeon, his Staff is more than excellent, especially Christina. Regarding the HSS overall service I could not be more satisfied, This hospital is out of this world, you can not compare the outstanding patient care and selection of staff there, about Dr.Edwin Su skills, well my hip operation was a total success ""perfect"".. Thank You Dr. Su."
Dr. Edwin Su,"After my co-worker and friend, Victor Shimmons, recommended Dr. Su I was a little skeptical. I did some research and decided Dr. Su was the best choice. Sure enough, 3 weeks later, I know made the best decision of my life. My surgery was on November 28th 2017. I can walk with a cane, bathe myself and get around really well! Dr. Su has a great bedside manner, is trustworthy and caring. I highly recommend him in any capacity. His staff is also very attentive and caring."
Dr. Edwin Su,"Dr Su did my total hip replacement .He is an excellent surgeon & i was up & walking right away. my whole experience was perfect from the moment i entered HSS. Christina who works In Dr Sus office was exceptional as well. I would recommend Dr Su 100%,he is the BEST!!!!!"
Dr. Edwin Su,"Left me crippled and unable to walk and in constant pain 24/7, with less movement in my hip than prior to the surgery. Then told me he could do nothing for me. Was lucky to find another surgeon who easily reconstructed the hip and now able to do yoga, walk miles and have a life again."
Dr. Edwin Su,Excellent surgeon. Highly recommend
Dr. Edwin Su,"Dr. Su is a gifted surgeon as well as a lovely person. He is well-versed on the most up-to-date procedures. I felt completely comfortable from the first time I met him, and he took his time to explain the procedure to me (anterior procedure of total hip replacement). My surgery went well, and I now feel like I have a new lease on life. I have no pain when I walk, and can do my 10,000 steps a day. I can't recommend him highly enough."
Dr. Edwin Su,"I am a female in my late 60's, not typical for Dr Su. Nonetheless he resurfaced each of my hips and each surgery was beautifully done with minimal scarring and great results, 3 and 7 years ago. When I needed a total knee replacement I was delighted to learn that one third of Dr Su's practice is knees. Within four weeks of his replacing my knee I had full flexion and could walk without assistance. Now at 10 weeks I am working on strength. Experienced PT's are amazed at my outstanding results."
Dr. Edwin Su,"I had both hips resurfaced 2 years apart. Dr. Su gave me back my active lifestyle. I can swim, bike and jog with no hip pain. Dr. Su is the best in hip resurfacing."
Dr. Edwin Su,"This MD met all my needs with the Birmingham Resurfacing. I was so grateful to him for performing this surgery on me. I was back on the job in 3 weeks. I made him my Health Care Proxy for the surgery, as only he could decide what I needed."
Dr. Edwin Su,"Simply the best! Responsive, thoughtful, innovative, and extraordinary competent. Interviewed 2 other doctors, before selecting. I chose to travel 2700 miles to use him, and had an outstanding outcome from hip resurfacing. Well worth the trip and effort, and great follow-up attention whenever there were questions or special assistance was needed. Would not hesitate to recommend HSS and Dr.Su to anyone wanting the best professional care available for hip surgery."
Dr. Edwin Su,I simply can't imagine a better experience. If you ever need a hip surfacing surgery Dr. Su is probably one of the best specialist in the world. !!!!
Dr. Edwin Su,I had complications after surgery. Once i started having complications the office seemed to lose interest and usually would not get back to me. I had to call many times and even then took 2 - 3 weeks to get any kind of response if i got a response at all. My emails to the PA were mostly ignored.
Dr. Edwin Su,The surgery appears to have gone very well. I had what appears to have been a small dural nick which has caused subsequent headaches. The recovery of the hip has been rapid in just 1.5 weeks.
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Dr. Rosenwasser is the best! After breaking my arm playing baseball, he was quick to help and perform a perfect surgery. Without his expertise D1 baseball would not have been a possibility again!! So grateful for such an amazing doctor"
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"I would NOT recommend seeing Dr. Rosenwasser. He is obviously well qualified and an intelligent person, however his lack of care, respect, and attention are what make him a horrible doctor. If you want someone who will be attentive to your case and will provide solutions, he is NOT the doctor for you. He treated me like absolute garbage and gave me no time of day (treated me like I was a bother). Faculty is rude and had multiple forms incorrectly process on their end."
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,Dr Melvin Rosenwasser is an excellent hand surgeon who pays special attention to his patients concerns and makes sure they get the best possible result when he operates. He is extremely patient and knowledgeable in orthopedics and answers every question a patient has during the visit. I had a biceps tendon rupture and it healed completely without any complications in about 3 months. I would recommend him highly. S. C. Shekher
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Amazing, caring, patient, superior surgical results!"
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Dr. Rosenwasser and his staff were excellent. The level of care was outstanding, and the doctor took time to explain all procedures and options. All were friendly and helpful."
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"got to the appointment went in for an x ray only to find out after that they made a mistake and dint accept my insurance, paid 500 out of pocket and was told the 250 for the xray would be covered, it wasn't, and the staff is very unhelpful"
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Dr.Rosenwasser is an exceptional surgeon! I had unresolved complications from a prior surgery involving ulnar nerve, ulnar ligament, & forearm flexor. I compete in Division I athletics but feared my issues were unresolvable and career over, and worried about long term effects. Dr. Rosenwasser expertly addressed all issues, essentially rebuilding my arm. I have now completed rehab and am throwing freely and with strength, thrilled and looking forward to this spring season."
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,Very good. My surgery (radiofrequency capsular shrinkage for an overstretched scapholunate ligament in my dominant wrist) was a complete success and exactly within the time frame he gave me.
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Dr. Rosenwasser is a kind and caring man. He explains everything thoroughly and answers every question that is asked. Thanks to him, I can now hold my grandson with confidence ( and there is no better feeling.) Not a day goes by that I am not grateful for the mobility that his skill and expertise has afforded me"
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"My experience with Dr. Rosenwasser was very positive. I was lucky enough to be referred to him by a friend who is an orthopedic surgeon, and was told he was one of the best hand surgeons in the county. Dr. Rosenwasser expertly repaired by broken wrist, and I healed extremely well. The occupational therapist working with me, marveled at my quick progress. It has been four months since I had the surgery and my hand is back to normal again. I am very grateful to Dr. Rosenwasser."
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Dr. Rosenwasser's pioneering surgical technique (RASL) for addressing torn scapholunate ligaments restored my wrist to near full function. After visiting 5 other surgeons and exhaustively studying literature on alternative surgical techniques, I concluded it was not close. The RASL surgery that Dr. R so skillfully performed on my wrist 5 years ago has allowed me at age 70 to keep up a very active life style--golf, basketball, biking, lifting weights, chopping wood, etc. Dr. R is outstanding."
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,I can strongly recommend Dr. Rosenwasser for your hand surgery - he explained what I needed to have done and how he would do it ...the best part was that he was optimistic of the outcome and was assuring that the end result would meet my needs and expectations. The entire surgery team was excellent as to be expected at NY Presbyterian. Follow-up care confirmed my expectations - great and helpful office staff.
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,Very professional and knowledgeable
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Dr. Rosenwasser expertise is ""off the charts good."" Thanks to him I have been able to return to all activities with no pain or discomfort. I suffered a wrist injury that severely limited the use of my left hand. I was told by doctors here in my home state ( one of which was from the National Wrist Center!!) that I would have to definitely change my lifestyle and surgery offered little hope. Thanks to Dr Rosenwasser and his brilliance I have been totally back to normal mobility for 6 years!!"
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"5 months post surgery for re-attachment of lateral ligament in my right elbow, I have 100% range of motion and no pain in the elbow. He also repaired damage to my tendons in same arm-so painful that I couldn't peel a potato or a carrot, and I have no pain between my wrist and elbow. I am gardening, taking yoga and pilates classes-and can do a plank again!"
Dr. Melvin Rosenwasser,"Dr. Rosenwasser, a brilliant, comprehensive and caring orthopedic surgeon corrected a complex wrist fracture with internal fixation 5 years ago. The surgery went well with 100% recovery. My wrist had been severely deformed from an accident; not only had my wrist returned to normal activity, it is aesthetically pleasing. Recently had a non-displaced fracture- rather than go to an ER, I wanted the best medical care. The staff quickly accommodated an appointment. Highly recommend Dr. Rosenwasser."
Dr. Douglas Padgett,Dr Kovacevic is an excellent Doctor. He takes his time during appointments and makes sure that you understand everything that needs to be done. Great Doctor!
Dr. Douglas Padgett,Save yourself the time and headache and see someone else. You are just a number to this guy and only cares about recommending unnecessary and costly procedures so he can make money off of you.
Dr. Douglas Padgett,Dr Kovacevic is an excellent Doctor. He is compassionate and very through. He spends the time to get to know his patients and cares about their well being. He was the third Doctor which I saw for my elbow problem and in 6 months my elbow issue was resolved. I look forward to returning to returning to tennis. Thank you!

Dr. Douglas Padgett,"Excellent surgeon ! The right decision... Four months after surgery I am once again able to throw a ball, work in the garden, go to the gym and, most importantly, sleep through the night. Thank you ""Dr. K"" for repairing my shoulder!"
Dr. Douglas Padgett,Dr K helped repair a fracture in my shoulder. He also fixed a hill-sach lesion that occurred due a fall. Dr. K was able to fix both the lesion and fracture arthroscopic ally which reduced pain and accelerated recovery. During our pre-op and subsequent meetings he always took the time to explain the surgical procedure as well as steps to speed recovery. I recommend Dr. K without hesitation based on my surgical results.
Dr. Douglas Padgett,"Highly recommend Dr. Kovacevic. He was clear with his diagnosis, course of treatment, expected risks and long term care. Got back to my normal routine quickly with no complications. Follow up visits were thorough, including explanations of my x-rays and overall healing process. My family, physical therapists and PCP were impressed with the result of my surgery. If you are in need of orthopedic care, then I suggest you consider him."
Dr. Douglas Padgett,Choosing and Having Dr Kovacevic as my elbow specialist was by far the right decision. His care and professionalism was outstanding. Dr. Kovacevic always took his time to hear my concerns and would always take time to explain medical procedures and would display all X-rays and MRI to me. My elbow is now so much better and my quality of life has been restored thanks to this surgery. I would definitely recommend this doctor to others.
Dr. Douglas Padgett,"My experience under Dr. Kovacevic has been excellent. From my first appointment, Dr Kovacevic always listened to my concerns and did his upmost to insure I had a good result. I never felt rushed during a appointment and all my questions were always answered. The bottom line is that I had a great surgical result and I am in a much better place when I presented Dr K with my shoulder issue."
Dr. Douglas Padgett,"I had an excellent experience with Dr. Kovacevic. He shared information about my condition in a way that allowed me to feel a part of the process. Seeing the work that was done, I would highly recommend his skills as a surgeon. He also made an extremely good OT referral. I couldn't have been in better hands."
Dr. Douglas Padgett,I was very nervous to the surgery but After I met with Dr Kovacevic I very assured to the surgery. On the day of surgery Dr Kovacevic was on my side to assure every thing will go well and sure enough the surgery went well and I'm recovering quicker than I previously thought. I'm glad and I feel very lucky to have Dr Kovacevic my doctor
Dr. Douglas Padgett,Shows real concern about my recovery

Dr. David Kovacevic,Shows real concern about my recovery
Dr. Gregory Difelice,"Almost never written a review before but feel compelled to do it here. Quite simply, Dr DiFelice is what an ideal surgeon should be - actually caring about you rather than running the meter, accessible and extremely competent. I tore my ACL in early 2012 (38 y old then) in a skiing accident. Came to him 4 months later and he tried what, at least at that time, only he was doing - reattaching the broken ACL as opposed to reconstructing one from another body part or a cadaver. He told me my c"
Dr. Gregory Difelice,"Dr. DiFelice did an amazing job fixing my shoulder! I had a bad snowboarding accident and first aid at the mountain said it was fine. 3 months later it still wasn't feeling quite right. Dr D operated on me and I'm stronger than ever! I race in marathons, triathlons, rock climb and yup, back on the snowboard. Thanks again Dr D!"
Dr. Gregory Difelice,Dr. DiFelice is a pioneer offerring ACL repair versus replacement for certain classifications of injury. The technique is minimally invasive and recovery is significantly faster than reconstrcution while saving your natural tissue. I was able to cross country ski within 5 weeks of surgery. Dr. D is amazing!
Dr. Gregory Difelice,Dr. DiFelice repaired my left shoulder which was fractured and dislocated playing ice hockey. He did a great job repairing my shoulder and got me back playing. He is thorough and top notch. I would highly recommend him to anyone with a shoulder injury.
Dr. Gregory Difelice,"An acquaintance had success with a hip replacement done by Dr. DiFelice. I talked with 3 doctors and we chose this doctor after weighing the superior facility of HSS and his abundance of confidence with his abilities. He was not especially warm and fuzzy, but we based our decision on his explanation of the procedure and confidence of a successful outcome. The experience was as he described. My results were impressive according to the visiting nurse. I healed quickly, followed all directions."
Dr. Gregory Difelice,"Rewarding! Less than 8 weeks post surgery for a partial knee replacement, I am better than ever. Working fulltime, commuting by mass transportation to NYC and pain free. Much better than anything I could have hoped for. His honest approach encouraged me to work hard at rehab to maximize the benefits of the procedure."
Dr. Gregory Difelice,He did extensive reconstruction surgery on my leg along with a total knee replacement. I felt I had the best doctor for my condition which had pained me most of my life. I would highly recommend him
Dr. Seth Jerabek,Superb team from A to Z...I had a THR with Dr Jerabek and his team. The care was AAA from all involved. Would recommend and have been sending friends and family members. Dr FDS
Dr. Seth Jerabek,My name is Subrahmanyam Gonuguntla I recently had total knee replacement surgery with Dr Jerabeck I strongly say that he is an excellent and knowledgeable doctor I am very much thankful to the doctor because of his tremendous work .I recommend everyone to this doctor.
Dr. Seth Jerabek,"Dr Jerabek performed a complicated total knee replacement on me 5 months ago. Results have been nothing short of miraculous. Range of motion is excellent and pain and swelling are non-existant. My PT's and friends are all is disbelief that scar is barely visible. While I know NY is loaded with good hospitals, HSS is the best in my opinion."
Dr. Seth Jerabek,Dr Jerabek is a kind and caring medical professional. My husband had to see him in an emergency and it was handled all was planned perfectly. His staff and private PA Morgan are always there to answer any questions of concern I would highly recommend him
Dr. Seth Jerabek,The best. Period.
Dr. Seth Jerabek,"Dr Jerabek is a rare combination of a skilled orthopedist and a man who is empathic and kind. After several consults with other orthopedists, Dr. Jerabek recommended the least invasive surgery; did not bad mouth the drs who did my previous surgeries and I couldn't be happier. Although only a week since surgery, I am in less pain than before the procedure. Dr Jerabek's office staff is responsive and efficient. His PA, Morgan Holt is easy to get ahold of and is extremely helpful."
Dr. Seth Jerabek,"TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT --- Dr.Jerabek transformed my life! I was born with hip dysplasia and felt the instability right from my childhood. Post-pregnancy, I developed severe arthritis. From almost complete disability, I am an active mom to my precious nine-year old daughter! Dr. Jerabek is not just a master in his trade, but he has compassion and the patience to listen and explain. A rare combination and a gem!"
Dr. Seth Jerabek,"Dr. Jerabeck is a miracle worker. He redid my hip. He is calm, cool, definite and brilliant. My hip kept coming out. No one wants to be a regular at the ER. There isn't enough praise I could offer. If he says he can 'fix you'- he can. He gave me my life back . Thank you so much"
Dr. Seth Jerabek,"...my femur was reduced to a consistency of ""cornflakes"" as a result of non-compatability of hardware used in a previous total hip implant. Dr Jerabek replaced my hip joint and reconstituted my rotten thigh bone resulting in my being able to live a normal life again. I can ride my fixed wheel bicycle all over NewYork for example."
Dr. Seth Jerabek,"Absolutely wonderful doctor and office staff! I was born with a dysplastic hip that led to acute arthritis. I had a total hip replacement at a relatively young age. Dr. Jerabek was patient in discussing the procedure with me and my husband. He is an extremely skilled surgeon and thanks to him, I am back on my feet again. The recovery time was very short, pain management was excellent and above everything, I am living an active, pain-free life."
Dr. Friedrich Boettner,"Very professional, knowledgeable. Anterior hip replacement with minimal pain. Did not need pain medicine at home, Climbed stairs next day with physical therapist and was discharged. Presently walking daily (3/4 mile). Exellent surgeon."
Dr. Friedrich Boettner,"Dr Boettner is very knowledgeable and cares about his patients. Not only is he a gifted surgeon and he also has a great bedside manner. My knee replacement scar is half the size of the typical scar and should fade so it is barely noticeable. My rheumatologist was amazed in how fast my knee healed. Although Dr. Boettner performs his surgeries in the city, he does have appointments conveniently in Westchester."
Dr. Friedrich Boettner,"Left knee completely replaced under Dr. Boettner and beyond happy (and grateful). After visiting 2 doctors locally and going through needless surgeries (scope and shots which did nothing) only Dr. Boettner said ""you need surgery, not today but def within 2 years). He's honest, professional and transparent. Did the surgery at HSS in NYC - amazing team. Going to phy therapy every patient there and nurses says the cut is so straight n small compared to others! I cannot recommend him enough, and HSS"
Dr. Friedrich Boettner,"I had an anterior THR on December 1, 2017, and I was home the next day. Dr. Boettner’s recommendation was “walk, walk, walk,” and although I was sceptical about not having physical therapy, I followed his instructions and within 2 weeks I was driving and back at the gym. He is an excellent surgeon; he is thorough and explained everything. I have and will continue to recommend him."
Dr. Friedrich Boettner,Dr. Boettner did my knee replacement at HSS in August 2017 and it was a total success!!! Iam very happy with the entire experience and am enjoying being able to walk and swim for exercise again
Dr. Friedrich Boettner,"I am 53yrs old and I have a complicated knee history back from when I was young and needed a tibial tuberosity relocation, a lateral release and other procedures to help deal with a regularly dislocating patella. Dr B was the only one of the 3 drs that that I consulted w that physically examined my knee and my history. He determined that surgery was not imminent and opted to try a cortisone injection. I am pain free for the first time in 6 mo. When I finally need the surgery dr B it is!"
Dr. Friedrich Boettner,Dr Boettner is a wonderful surgeon. He did bilateral hip replacements 3 months apart and I have my life back. I am very grateful and I highly recommend him
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,Dr Della Valle is superb! A very caring and expert surgeon who takes the time to answer all your questions. He inspires confidence from the moment you meet him. I had hip replacement surgery and the experience was outstanding - including his staff who are patient and helpful. I highly recommend him to anyone who is considering knee or hip replacement surgery. You will not be disappointed! Thank you so much Dr Della Valle!!!
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"Dr. GDV replaced both my hips 18 months apart. I am extremely pleased with both the process and the results. Dr GDV thoroughly explained the surgery and was helpful in my post-op recovery. The entire HSS experience was well-planned and well-executed. The hospital staff was outstanding. My recovery from both operations went smoothly. I was walking immediately, hiking in 4-5 weeks and on the golf course in week 6. I'm so pleased to be back to my old self. Thanks Dr. GDV and HSS!"
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"With Dr. Della Valle, I knew I was in good hands. That was not the case with two other surgeons whom I had consulted about hip replacement. Dr. Della Valle took the time to address every one of my concerns, and I'm thrilled with the outcome of the surgery. I was back at yoga and regular workouts in a matter of months. And on trips, I can walk for miles!"
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"Words cannot truly explain all there is to say about Dr. GonzalezDellaValle. He has performed a total hip replacement, followed by 2 total knee replacements...I am speaking from experience! Not only is his expertise superb, but his compassionate bedside manner would be difficult to match. He strictly focuses on ONLY you while attentively listening to your concerns. He thoroughly explains everything in his gentle, caring manner. I feel as if he is my friend that turned me into a bionic woman!"
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,Dr Della Valle replaced both my hips & just recently had the right one done all went great! He for me was direct with what I needed he is gentle & kind and I was so at ease with everything! His P A is wonderful and the whole environment at HSS is so professional! I recommend him highly 5 ????
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"Dr. DellaValle is an outstanding surgeon with an excellent, gentle, bedside manner. He really knows his stuff & inspired complete confidence in me & my family. He was willing to take the time to answer and explain all our questions and never made us feel like he thought we were wasting his time. 1 year after Bi-lateral hip replacement (age 60) I am strong, healthy, full of energy - walking, hiking, doing yoga, weight training & more with confidence and joy. Wish I'd heard of Dr DV years ago."
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"I had a knee replacement not by Dr. DellaValle. I continued spinning classes. On the way to my father's funeral I found myself falling down and broke my femur. I came to HSS by ambulance and met Dr. DellaValle. My knee and femur were a mess. Dr fixed my femur with screws. After 3 months he put in another knee replacement because the first was compromised from the fall. He is a saint for putting me back together, I spin no more but play lots of golf. I am indebted to him for my quality of life"
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"Dr. Della Valle performed revision surgery on my right knee replacement on 8/22/18. My original right knee replacement (done by another doctor)was off track. The first day the PT got me to stand up, I immediately felt a difference. The knee felt straighter & stronger. While I’m only one week out of surgery, I know this time it’s going to be different. Thanks to Dr. DellValle & his fantastic staff for giving me this second chance."
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"Dr GonzalezDellaValle has performed two hip replacements for my husband and I cannot say enough about his expertise and thorough post operative care! We are so impressed, and feel very fortunate to have been in his care! We highly recommend!!!"
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"Dr. Della Valle is fabulous. I had broken my right hip but developed avascular necrosis. I found Dr. Della Valle at Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC and the entire process was tremendous. He is so caring, we could talk to each other so everything was carefully explained. I was in good hands. Surgery went smoothly, this hospital is 1st class and the cleanest hospital in the US. The nurses are highly trained, intelligent, caring. He is very brilliant. 7 yr's now, pain free. TMO"
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,Very good doctor my knees replacement surgery was a success!! I can walk again!
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,Dr. Gonzalez Della Valle performed knee revision surgery on my left knee three years after my original knee replacement surgery that was performed by another orthopedist was causing me problems. I am finally able to walk pain free after suffering for all that time. He was able to assess the situation and and explain to me what needed to be done to make the problem better. I am so happy that I went ahead with the revision
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,"The doctor replaced my hip over 4 years ago and ever since I have been in pain. Not only is he of no help (after 2 surgeries), he's extremely condescending. I hope other people have a better experience."
Dr. Alejandro GonzalezDellaValle,After several surgeries with no improvement Dr Della Valle performed a TKR on my left knee. The only regret I have is that I did not know about him sooner.
Dr. Herbert Cooper,"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Cooper. Not only did he both quickly diagnose my pelvic discontinuity fracture, he performed revision surgery. Even though he had to put a cup cage in my pelvis and a special total hip replacement I have had the best recovery yet from surgery and was walking without a cane 2 1/2 weeks from surgery."
Dr. Herbert Cooper,"I had debilitating pain for months following a hip replacement, and my surgeon was entirely dismissive. Terrified, I searched the internet for what could have gone wrong. I found Dr. Cooper's name attached to one promising study, looked him up, and got an appt. Despite the 5-hr. drive. I will be forever grateful to have found him. He found my problem immediately via his XRays. He calmed my fears. He is a genius and will handle a revision if necessary, as well as my other hip in a few mos."
Dr. Herbert Cooper,"After a failed hamstring surgery I tried making appointments with numerous surgeons who refused to see me post surgery. Dr. Cooper was not only willing to see me, he spent a great deal of time reviewing my MRIs, surgery notes, and hearing my story. Dr. Cooper was able to assess where I needed to go for help and he arranged that for me, spending yet more of his time reaching out to the doctor to explain my complex situation. Dr. Cooper is an exceptionally caring doctor and human."
Dr. Herbert Cooper,I drive 2 1/2 hours each way to see Dr. Cooper and wouldn't waste my time with anyone on the way. He is the best.
Dr. Herbert Cooper,I SAW DR COOPER FOR RIGHT HIP REPLACEMENT... DR COOPER DESERVES A 5 STAR REVIEW..HE WAS COMPASSIONATE AND CARING..HE TOOK THE TIME TO THOROUGHLY EXPLAIN MY PROBLEM AND TREATMENT. HE ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND DID NOT RUSH ME OUT OF THE OFFICE AS SOME DOCTORS TEND TO DO..HE SHOWED ME THE XRAY OF THE TOOLS USED FOR MY HIP REPLACEMENT..IN 2 WEEKS AM WALKING IN THE HOME WITHOUT A CANE.
Dr. Herbert Cooper,"My husband, sister-in-law, and I all see Dr. Cooper. Knee problems run in the family!"
Dr. Herbert Cooper,I found Dr Cooper knowledgeable about my knee issue and compassionate to my concerns and pain
Dr. Herbert Cooper,"My own experience with Dr. Cooper has been terrific. He's an excellent communicator & his staff is highly professional & easy to deal with. For myself, a total right hip replacement was the culmination of an 8 month long saga after a violent fall that first evidenced a right inguinal hernia, then an MRI showed what appeared to be a fracture of the femur. Dr. Cooper explained that it wasn't a basic fracture and that a full right hip replacement was needed. Throughout both he and his team were 5*"
Dr. Frederick Buechel Jr,"Dr. Buechel's professionalism, patient interaction and care is unparalleled. I have never met a doctor so willing to explain the procedure and so caring. HIs passion for modern medicine is undeniable. His staff also deserves as much credit as the doctor. So friendly. So efficient. So helpful. They should give lessons in healthcare office management."
Dr. Charles Jobin,Finally a doctor who puts the patient first. Forever greatful for Dr. Jobin and his team for getting me back to full strength! HE IS THE BEST!
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Highest quality care I’ve ever received. From my very first appointment until my full recovery following surgery Dr. Jobin and his team treated me with the greatest amount of respect, care and I am forever greatful for Dr. Jobin giving me full use of my arm again. If you are thinking of having surgery anywhere else you are making the wrong choice. I would highly recommend seeing Dr. Jobin for an evaluation before making any decisions elsewhere. He and his athletic trainer Marc are the best!!!!"
Dr. Charles Jobin,Best surgeons in New Yor City. Had my shoulder replaced over a year ago and the expertise and care you receive by Dr. Jobin and his assistant Marc are bar none the best in the business

Dr. Charles Jobin,He is the best!
Dr. Charles Jobin,"super personable, great at explaining care to patients"
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Very little wait and highly coordinated with x-Ray evaluation. Was clearly an excellent diagnostician and showed me areas of inflammation and vulnerability on the film so I could understand. Also areas of strength in my shoulder. Conservative ( which I liked ) in delaying more intrusive steroid injection and more of a ""let's see with time and exercise"" approach, icing etc. . Visit inculded a manual evaluation of the shoulder strength an flexibility. Personal, professional and precise!"
Dr. Charles Jobin,Excellent
Dr. Charles Jobin,My experience with Dr. Jobin was nothing but great. He listened and he gave me his professional on how to care for my shoulder pain. Within 2 days i felt so much better.

Dr. Charles Jobin,Fantastic! His staff is wonderful to deal with. Very professional and efficient. Dr Jobin was late and he apologized as soon as he came in the room.

My shoulder healed through PT and it feels great now! All in all a great experience. Id highly recommend Dr Jobin!
Dr. Charles Jobin,Knowledgeable and friendly. Always concerned with getting the best outcomes
Dr. Charles Jobin,Highest level of care and after surgical commitment.
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr. Jobin is personable, caring and takes time to listen to patient, then explains options and procedures. He epitomizes the consummate medical professional! So glad he was referred to me by my primary care doctor, Maxwell Chait."
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr. Jobin and his staff are professional, courteous, attentive and compassionate. Dr. Jobin exhibits the right amount of curiosity by asking questions to understand your condition and experience so that he can recommend appropriate and personalized treatment plan. He performed laproscopic surgery on me to repair my torn rotator cuff 3 years ago. I healed beautifully and I recovered well and I was extremely pleased with the results."
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr Jobin is amazingly professional and warm. My livelihood depends on my shoulder, and he got my shoulder is pretty much back to normal. Best experience by far (I went for consultantions to a few other top hospitals in NYC)"
Dr. Charles Jobin,Great doctor! He always takes time to explain every X-ray and procedure. Highly recommended!

Dr. Charles Jobin,"The entire team is wonderful. Dr J explained all the options for and against surgery, answered all my questions. Cant wait for the surgery"
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr. Jobin and Marc (his Physician Assistant) are two of the best in orthopedics. Dr. Jobin is one of the very best surgeons in not only New York City but the country. His bed side manner and skills are impeccable. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Jobin and his team and would not recommend having surgery anywhere else for surgery. Their compassion, willingness to answer questions, bedside manner, and time spent with me are bar none the best in medicine. A big thank you to the both of them."
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Initial discussion help us understand the situation of my wife's rotator injury and the best options to go forward. We felt we understand clearly the options, risk, and what needed to be done to minimize risk and prepare for surgery."
Dr. Charles Jobin,It is a pleasure to be Dr. Jobin's patient. Seeing him for an office visit is reassuring and very comfortable. He is most professional and knowledgeable. I have total confidence in his work.
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr. Jobin was professional, personable and thorough. After diagnosing the source of my pain and recommending a course of action, he took time to explain my x-rays to confirm the diagnosis."
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr. Jobin is a gifted surgeon and did a fantastic job on a reverse shoulder replacement. I have regained fantastic mobility 7 weeks post-op, however, the most amazing thing for me is how relatively pain free I have been since the surgery. If any one needs shoulder surgery, I highly recommend Dr. Jobin."
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr Jobin listened carefully to me. His medical expertise, combined with his easy manner, instilled confidence in me."
Dr. Charles Jobin,Dr. jobin is a very caring doctor. He is compassionate and take his time to treat his patients.
Dr. Charles Jobin,Dr. Jobin is the ONLY surgeon I would ever recommend for rotator cuff repair. I had pretty extensive damage and my recovery was amazing. Pain was minimal and I did not require opioids. Two weeks post-op my physical therapist was astounded at how much range of motion I already had. Six weeks after surgery I spent 10 days in Greece for work/vacation and felt great!
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Dr. Jobin is the ultimate professional. I am so grateful to be under his care. During my visit he took the time to listen to my concerns regarding my shoulder and reviewed treatment plan options with me, answering all of my questions. The office team members are respectful, efficient and communicate regularly with each other to provide safe care. My follow up MRI and MD appointment were coordinated on the spot before leaving the office."
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Great, and friendly"
Dr. Charles Jobin,I was very nervous about surgery. Dr. Jobin convinced me that I needed it and assured me that I had chosen the right doctor. I certainly did. Dr. Jobin is the best.
Dr. Charles Jobin,"I can’t thank Dr.Jobin enough. After initially being diagnosed with a bruised shoulder. I went to Dr. Jobin for his opinion and he noticed the complete tear of my shoulder. He recommended surgery and after surgery my shoulder is almost back to the way it was before. He made me feel like I was part of the family. And when I thought my shoulder wouldn’t get better, he always made me feel better and assured me it will. I can’t thank Dr. Jobin enough!!"
Dr. Charles Jobin,"This is the place to go! I felt almost zero pain post op and my recovery three weeks later is astonishing. Dr. Jobin is a rock star. Not to mention he has the ""A"" team working alongside. He genuinely cares for his patients and proved it with an amazing bedside manner and personally followed up after surgery. I would recommend him without hesitation and wish I would have gone to him first and saved myself 3 weeks of agony at Mount Sinai with error after error. Kudos Doc to you and team!!"
Dr. Charles Jobin,Dr Jobin navigated me through my shoulder issues in a way I’ve been able to understand. I received in lay terms exactly what to expect & what lies ahead. He’s thorough & compassionate. I was never rusted during an appointment. His support staff is excellent as well.
Dr. Charles Jobin,"He's a very qualified and caring doctor. Unfortunately in .y case I felt he went on autopilot for awhile when I didn't feel cared for but when he returned he was very available, quite nice, interested in me and effective."
Dr. Charles Jobin,Really a great and professional experience. The whole office is very well run --- truly a pleasure to deal with Dr. Jobin and his staff.
Dr. Charles Jobin,"Great Bedside manner. Thoroughly went through each step of my surgical procedure, as well as post op expectations. Excellent surgeon. My Bicep was completely torn off the bone, and I felt I was in great hands from Day 1 with Dr. Jobin. Highly recommend for any Upper Extremity injury. Biceps is doing great, and the follow up from Team Jobin has been phenomenal from the office visits to follow up phone calls."
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,Dr. Lehman is an excellent doctor who thoroughly goes through your medical conditions and provides a gameplan moving forward that’s best for you.
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,"After a bad result from a spinal fusion done by another surgeon, I came to Dr. Lehman with little hope and low expectations. Two years later I can honestly say visiting him was a life changing decision. Dr. Lehman performed a second fusion with more substantial hardware and two years out I’m off pain killers and pain free. After 6 years of pain, I finally feel like myself again. Thank you, Dr. Lehman."

Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,"When I began the process of looking for a surgeon, Dr Lehman was the first I visited with. After the initial consultation I knew I came to the right man. I didn’t bother with a second opinion. He did the surgery Aug 30th, it is now Oct 8th and I am feeling better every day. All the pain I had before the surgery is completely gone! I can’t tell you the relief I feel, I simply do not have the words. He gave me my life, myself back. I am so very appreciative of Dr. Lehman and his wonderful staff."

Overall, my experience and recovery has been amazing and I would definitely recommend Dr. Lehman to anyone."
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,"I had a lot of pain before surgery. I couldn’t stand up or walk, my quality of life was poor. After my surgery my pain wasn’t there anymore, I could stand up longer and walk further.

Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,"Upon diagnosis of my ruptured disc, I was referred to Dr Lehman. As a New Yorker, I had the opportunity to choose from the best and made the right decision. Dr Lehman is an excellent physician, his nurses are always available to answer questions preceding and post-surgery. The Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital is a state of the art pristine facility.

Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,"Surgery was smooth, staff was really attentive & was able to go home same day. Remote check up every 2 weeks was helpful to track healing process & have all questions answered. 7 weeks post surgery I’m back to my normal routine, walking about 5 miles a day, starting core strengthening exercises & able to go back to the gym, all things that I stopped doing prior to the surgery."
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,"I come to his office with severe pain in my back, he didn’t find nothing wrong in my back. Although MRI and x-rays show in my back, scoliosis, spinal canal , 5 herniate disks,"
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,"I felt most comfortable with Dr. Lehman, his staff and the staff at Columbia Allen hospital. After visiting several doctors for my condition I felt that I had found the right team to correct my condition. I am so glad that I kept looking for the right team."
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,Dr. Lehman and his team were amazing from the first visit to the post-op follow up. This was my 2nd scoliosis surgery and I would never have imagined I could have received this much correction and a new chance at a pain free and active lifestyle. I traveled from out of state to receive care from this amazing team.
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,Great experience and fixed my back! Wasn’t a routine procedure and Dr. Lehman took the time to address it
Dr. Ronald Lehman Jr,Dr. Lehman new exactly what I needed and was fast and Efficient in getting the help I needed.

Given the dire status of my spine, the results for my spine are miraculous! I walk 6 miles daily since Jan. 2018! Dr. Lehman & his team provided EXTRAORDINARY care before, during & after my surgery.

I am very happy with the surgery and his staff, they were fantastic and I'm very satisfied."
Dr. Chuan Chang,"Don’t even bother!!!! Tried to see DR. Chang for my 20 month old son and what a huge disappointment. Both Receptionist were completely clueless. Neither one knew anything about insuarrance nor how to input new patients in the system. They had to call some one on the phone for help. She also kept asking me for a referral that I didn’t need with 1199 Insurrance. Lastly, I wasn’t able to see the Dr due to their incompetence. Rather then go speak to the Dr for possible solutions, she just put her"
Dr. Chuan Chang,"My son saw her for half year for treatment, the doctor cannot really explain what she is going to do and how we can help my son. Simple question test by the acception clerk to evaluate my son' status then give some pills. What you can expect the result. Don't waste your time and money with her."
Dr. Stephanie Shaps,Very impressed with Dr Shaps and her attention to my daughters overall wellbeing. This was our first visit with her and my daughter said she's awesome when we left. She listened patiently to some concerns we had and came up with a game plan to start now and future plans if these don't work. So happy that we have found a pediatrician we can depend on and know will give us sound advice.
Dr. Stephanie Shaps,Very informative about my sons developmental milestones and eczema.
Dr. Stephanie Shaps,"Dr. Shaps is an extraordinary pediatrician. Her staff is very friendly, making appointments is easy, and we have an enormous amount of trust and confidence in both doctor and staff for our newborn daughter."
Dr. Farid Moustofi,"Excellent doctor, takes time to listen and answer questions. Very balanced when prescribing medication - not overly aggressive with antibiotics, at the same time not too conservative. Dr Verma has been seeing my daughter since her 2 day wellness visit. Highly recommend her..."
Dr. Eddie Yang,compassionate and takes excellent care of my children
Mekhla Varma,Dr. Varma has been our pediatrician since my first son was born in 2015. She is extremely kind and patient and an excellent medical doctor. She takes her name in answering all my questions when I was a first time mom and never rushes you out of the room. I trust all her advice and will continue having her see my kids. Love Dr Varma.
Mekhla Varma,"I have been a patient of Dr Verma since my baby daughters birth. I can not recommend her more highly. She’s approachable, kind and extremely dedicated. It’s obvious that neonatal care and breastfeeding are areas that she’s passionate about and I attribute our family’s breast feeding and sleep training successes with my daughter entirely to her. She always takes the time to answer my (often inane) questions in a detailed way. As a parent herself, she offers sensible parenting advice. Love her!"
Mekhla Varma,"Was not impressed with this provider at all. She is incredibly difficult to get a word in edge wise with. Gives unsolicited advice that is NOT medical advice, but personal parenting advice which I would never use because it USB’s not the cultural norm or acceptable in my family. Perhaps the provider and the practice should stick with being doctors and lose the parenting advice."
Mekhla Varma,Several of my friends take their kids to Dr. Varma and I finally switched to her two years back based on their reviews. I am glad I did as Dr. Varma is very attentive and never makes us feel rushed. She is thorough in examining and patient in answering our questions. A couple of times we had some medical situations with kids while traveling abroad and she was always very prompt in getting back with relevant input on addressing the situation. We are glad to have her in this area.
Mekhla Varma,"Very good experience with Dr. Varma for my two kids. She saw them both from birth and was my preferred provider at the office that we go to. She was always thorough, listened well and was great with my kids."
Mekhla Varma,"Excellent doctor, takes time to listen and answer questions. Very balanced when prescribing medication - not overly aggressive with antibiotics, at the same time not too conservative. Dr Verma has been seeing my daughter since her 2 day wellness visit. Highly recommend her..."
Mekhla Varma,"If you're looking for a smart, personable and involved pediatrician for your child, I would recommend Dr. Varma in a heartbeat. I am deeply impressed by her clinical skills and the time she takes to address all questions despite her tight schedule. My 2 kids and I adore her!"
Mekhla Varma,compassionate and takes excellent care of my children
Dr. Sujan Patel,"Dr. Patel is a wonderful doctor! During my appointment with him, he was very thorough and made sure to answer all of my questions sufficiently. He was very knowledgeable and I did not feel rushed at all, as I usually do with other doctors. His office also provided me with a sheet containing thorough information about my medical problem, which was also very helpful. After the appointment, I have messaged him through an online portal and he replied quickly. Definitely would recommend!"
Dr. Sujan Patel,"This is my 2nd review regarding Dr. Patel. As I noted before, my visit was suboptimal. After reading my review, instead of reaching out to me directly via the contact info in my file, he chose to respond online so as to appear responsive and to blunt the effect of my review. His office never contacted me, I waited an hour, he was curt, and I learned nothing from the visit. Then I was billed over $300 for a dismissive session with no aftercare instructions. This is simply egregious."
Dr. Sujan Patel,I took my 12 year old daughter to see Dr. Patel today and could not have been more impressed with the whole experience. Office staff was very helpful and kind. Dr. Patel very patiently and wisely reviewed my daughter's file and offered useful suggestions and explanations. Both my daughter and I are very happy to have such a professional and thoughtful allergy doctor to help and advise us.
Dr. Sujan Patel,"I plan on seeing Dr. Patel on a regular basis for advice and for any allergy/intolerance related symptoms that need to be disabused. Dr. Patel is calm and analytical if you give him enough data and he'll ask the baseline questions and grow from there. If you really want to have a great appointment with him just open up and crack a few jokes. It might take a little to warm him up, but he's a lot of fun once a rapport is built, which for some might be a few visits, but for me we kicked it off fast"
Dr. Sujan Patel,"The best part about this doctor you send him message about any problem he is will reply asap. He will send you suggestion over the MyChart app. Like couple of weeks before I had no appointment with him even I didn't send him message for couple of weeks. He sent me message and was asking me about my health. I can gurantee he does care about his patients more than any other doctor. I can bet if you go to see him once, You will never go to find another doctor."
Dr. Sujan Patel,"My 1 yr old daughter has been seeing Dr. Patel since I introduced solids, and confirmed that she has multiple food allergies. He and his staff have been absolutely amazing with her! My daughter can be fussy, so it really helps that I have never had to wait more than a few minutes. Dr. Patel really takes his time during each visit and answers all my questions (which can be a lot!). He also responds quickly and thoroughly to emails and makes me feel like my daughter is a real priority. Highly rec!"
Dr. Sujan Patel,Dr. Patel gave me excellent care. He is very generous with his time and a thoughtful and caring physician.
Dr. Sujan Patel,"Sujan is one of the best physicians I know. He is extremely well rounded not just in the field of allergy, but also in total whole body medicine. Sujan is very sensitive to his patients needs, open to answering all manner of questions in a manner that the average patient can understand."
Dr. Sujan Patel,"Dr. Patel spends more time with me than any other physician I have seen. I really appreciate the extra effort he puts into creating what I call custom care by providing a sheet with all my tests, diagnosis, and a plan written in plain English. Going to the doctor is stressful, but he always puts me at ease with his humor and genuine concern for my health."
Dr. Sujan Patel,Knows his stuff but is needs to improve listening skills and overall interest displayed.
Dr. Noel Smith,Dr. Smith is extremely knowledgeable and took the time to explain my medical condition to me. He is very empathetic and is always trying to improve my quality of life. I have been going to him for 15 years and will continue to see him. I have recommended him to friends and family members who were just as pleased with his care as I am.
Dr. Noel Smith,I recently visited Dr. Smith for my annual physical exam and was pleased with getting an appointment with short notice. He is very informative and able to teach while examining. I highly recommend seeing him. It may save your life!
Dr. Noel Smith,"I have been Dr. Smith's patient for 10+ some years. I have had to see other doctors on the occasion when he was not immediately available, and would not want to have to change my doctor for any reason. Heis intelligent, caring, and he listens carefully to what you are telling him about your symptoms. He is an amazing person and physician."
Dr. Noel Smith,"Seeing Dr. Smith for almost a year now, having diabetes, high blood pressure, ow back pain. He switched my Diabetes medication to Farxiga, from Amaryl, and for the first time in abut 8 years, my blood sugar is the lowest it has ever been. I have lost over 40 lbs. (Farxiga suppresses your appetite), and since I lost so much weight, my BP is now normal, and I am no longer taking the BP meds. Now we are working on lowering the Diabetes Meds even more, by adding Bydureon, then working on my back"
Dr. Noel Smith,This is attempt 3 for me noe. I have been a patient of my friend and Doctor for over 3 years. If your a self fuelling pill popper who crystal like a bit cheaper when he does not get what he wants probably not going to be 2 good fit. If your looking for a loyal Doctor with ACCURATE diagnosis than look no further than Doc Smith. Please don't let the staff sway you from seeing this MN he works hard at his practice and more importantlyrics treats you with dignity ND respect. Hats off to doc.
Dr. Noel Smith,"No other doctor besides Dr. Smith (out of all the doctors I have seen) have been able to put me on the right medication. Thank to Dr. smith, he listens, cares, and has me fully functioning the way I should be"
Dr. Noel Smith,Dr Smith has provided consistently excellent care to my family and others for 15 plus years using high quality traditional/ holistic principles(Integrative medicine). Grandfather developed Temporal Arteritis (inflammation of head arteries) with blindness and physical deterioration on Steroids. Dr Smith detected/corrected the cause saving his vision and life. The strangely critcal previous post on this website is probably a resolvable communication issue with good care as we have gotten
Dr. Noel Smith,I would not recommend Dr. Smith. I do not think he is a competent doctor. He made mistakes and did not listen.
Dr. Michael Defeo,Dr. DeFeo is very professional and tentative to the needs and concerns of his patients and their parents. He makes the time to explain the circumstances and options available. We have four children and have been with Dr. DeFeo for over 12 years. We feel very secure in his care.
Dr. Nicole Sandover,Went in for a weight check for our newborn daughter. Dr. Sandover was thorough with good attention to detail. She answered all of our questions and didn’t rush us.
Dr. Nicole Sandover,"We love Dr Sandover. She is always willing to spend time with us to answer our questions. Even we moved away from the city, we still keep her as our daughter’s pediatrician."
Dr. Nicole Sandover,Excellent Dr! Very thorough and proactive in her care of our daughter. Always provides us with comprehensive explanations and answers to our questions. Her bedside manner is such that our 4 year old wants to grow up and be a pediatrician and work in the same office as Dr. Sandover. (This is in stark contrast to our experience with her prior pediatrician; our daughter would scream through the entire visit!) I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Sandover!
Dr. Nicole Sandover,Doctor Sandover is very professional and passionate when treating our children. Couldn’t be happier with her expertise. Highly recommended
Dr. Dominika Wittek,"Wonderful pediatrician. It was scary as a new parent. Dr. Wittek is experienced, knowledgeable and approachable. We could not be more happy"
Dr. Corey Wasserman,"Dr. Wasserman has a great demeanor with children, and is wonderful at putting them at ease—even those who may not be the biggest fans of the doctor’s office (like my son with Autism). She also listens to the parent’s concerns and gives very digestible diagnoses in layman’s terms, so everything is easily understood. Wait times in the office are very minimal. Overall, she makes a dr’s visit less anxiety-filled, so both the child and parent can leave with a smile on their faces."
Dr. Corey Wasserman,Awesome doctor with great bedside manner. We love her!
Dr. Corey Wasserman,Amazing doctor!! Love he
Dr. Corey Wasserman,"I feel we r very fortunate to use Dr Wasserman as our family pediatrician. She came HIGHLY recommended to us from 2 different friends and believe me, I now know why. Everything u would wish for in your doctor. Look no further ! She's the one to use"
Dr. Corey Wasserman,"Dr Wasserman is fantastic, an absolute delight that treated our daughter from newborn to past age of 2 (until we moved to NJ, too far for routine visits) with absolute care and amazing knowledge and presence. I would highly recommend Dr Wasserman and would still be bringing our daughter if the office location to our new suburban home was closer. We will truly miss her"
Dr. Corey Wasserman,We believe it is with good fortune our family came to find a pediatrician as wonderful as is Dr. Wasserman. She take time to talk with me and also the children. She very friendly and puts us all at ease every time.
Dr. Corey Wasserman,"I was compelled to leave 5 star review although I rarely post anything!! Dr Wasserman should be ( if not already is) on the "" Ten Best"" list for Pediatricians anywhere. Her manner, patience, knowledge etc are indeed unique and remarkable..... A perfect doctors office experience for kids and adults alike!!"
Dr. Marina Margolin,"An amazing doctor, been with her forever and plan to keep it this way"
Dr. Marina Margolin,It was my second visit and i am very happy with the treatment I am getting. All my problems and concerns were taken care of and i even got medications from doctor. Saved me a trip to the pharmacy and dealing with my insurance not covering my meds
Dr. Marina Margolin,"She always spends a lot of time with me answering all my questions and addressing all concerns, and I usually have a lot. She knows me and my medical issues very well and always takes care of all of it. Just knowing that I have a doctor who really cares about me and always willing to help makes me feel safe"
Dr. Marina Margolin,"Finally found a good doctor. Listens, answers questions, spends time with patient as much as needed. I have no complaints but respect for her professionalism."
Dr. Marina Margolin,"After seeing a few doctors, I found the one for me. Dr.Margolin is honest, knowledgeable and caring."
Dr. Marina Margolin,"After seeing a few doctors, I found the one for me. Dr.Margolin is honest, knowledgeable and caring."
Dr. Marina Margolin,"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! I'm a first time pacient, made an appointment for Jan 16t, the nurse called me back later the day I made the appointment to confirm insurance information. Monday comes, I am at the doctor's office for 15 minutes trying to get in, so I call to ask someone to open for me, thinking the receptionist might be at lunch break or something, and the office is CLOSED! I really hope I don't get charged for ""missing"" an appt! You just lost a patient."
Dr. Marina Margolin,"Recently I've been seen by Dr.Margolin and found myself pleasantly surprised. In 3 words: smart, caring, experienced."
Dr. Marina Margolin,"I've been going to Dr. Margolin for 2 years now and I'v always has positive experience. She is very friendly and listens to you. If need be, she'll suggest tests to confirm everything is ok with you or not. I would rather undergo tests and be rest assured that I'm ok instead of being in the dark. She was able to say just by looking at my scar what it was (which my dermatologist couldn't !!!). She helped me with my pregnancy as well. Natalie(at front desk) is great and always honors urgent appt"
Dr. Jose Lares-Guia,"incredible diagnostician, wonderful patient skills - love this guy"
Dr. Serena Ferguson,"Compassionate, Caring and wonderful"
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,"Dr Baserdem is very professional. He possess a wealth of knowledge, active listening and compassion that is vitally important when treating with patients. He is people oriented and you'd quickly develop a sense of comfort during your doctor appointment. Additionally, the staff at Northwell Health Physician Partners, Chelsea operate on an optimal level. They have good customer service and time management"
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,Great physician! However the staff is very unreliable. I asked them to fax me my blood test results a few days after my appointment. It has been about 2 and a half weeks and I still have not received it. The guy I spoke to was very rude and seemed to be frustrated and annoyed talking to me. I called again today and asked them to fax me the results. The woman I spoke to took my information said the results are on its way. All day has passed and I still did not receive it. Staff is not helpful!!!
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,"Had a great experience with Dr. Baserdem on my first office visit with him. He's genuine, personable and made me feel very comfortable. He's very thorough and concerned. He has good bed side manners which makes it easy to talk to him about private matters. I'd definitely recommend him and would definitely see him again."

Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,excellent experience. he is very knowledgeable and very easy to talk to.

Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,"I had a great experience with Dr. Baserdem. He's kind, patient, and personable, and I felt very comfortable. I'd recommend him to anyone."
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,"The doctor is personable and concerned. He cares about his patients and that has been reflected in my experience with him. He called me back with test results and checked on me personally, unlike other doctors who I've had to track down to get test results or have health questions answered. I was referred by my doctor of 20 years when he retired and it's nice to get started with a doctor who is similar in his diligence and commitment to patient care."
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,Dr. Baserdem is one of the most amazing primary care doctors I have ever had. He is truly personable and really cares. I would suggest him to any and everyone looking for a new primary care. All of my appointments have been on-time and not rushed. Dr. Baserdem really listens to everything I have to say and treats me individually not like just another number moving through the office.
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,Very attentive and considerate of my needs. Was well versed with my medical history and treated me thoroughly and with great care.
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,Very professional and attentive to my questions. Consulted with other doctors on the first visit

Dr. Baserdem truly and genuinely cares for his patients' well-being, and during each of my appointments were very thorough and engaging, answering any questions I had in detail.

I have since recommended a few friends to see him and they all have nothing but great things to say as well! Thank you, Dr. Baserdem!"
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,"I came to Dr. Baserdem trying to get out of mediocre service and poor attention to the concerns I had regarding my health care.

Dr. Baserdem spent easily 40 minutes with me and his assistant spent another 25 minutes. Thorough, interested, knowledgeable and friendly. I am so glad to have found this Medical Group."
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,He has the best bed side and concern manner I've ever witnessed in a doctor. I highly recommend him as a primary or any other kind of physician.
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,It's very obvious that Dr. Baserdem cares deeply for all his patients. I felt very well taken care of from the moment i walked through the door to the time i was checking out.

Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,Not only is Dr. B a caring person but each of the staff members at the office are all wonderful.

Such a pleasant experience I've convinced my younger brother to retain Baserdam as his PCP also.
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,"Dr. Baserdem, is knowledgeable, caring, a great diagnostician, and easily reachable. His manner is calm, friendly and he listens. He takes the time to review and explain details, steps, processes and any medical records/information that I bring to the visit. Under his care, I have been successfully treated for multiple issues. Additionally, the office staff is courteous and efficient with little wait time, I never feel rushed through.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
Dr. Baturalp Baserdem,"Really friendly and knowledgeable , makes you feel at ease. Excellent facility and he is just a great all round guy"
Dr. Cynthia Tam,"Dr. Tam is rude and unhelpful. Her bedside manners need a bit of improvement. She would not listen to my concerns or answer simple questions. I spent a while waiting for her, and at the end only received a few minutes of her time. At least give me a proper examination and reassure me in a professional way if there are no health concerns. Wasted my time and money. This is an office that tries to squeeze in as many patients as possible, not give them proper attention, and bills insurance. Avoid."
Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"I was diagnosed last year with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The conventional treatment for NTM is two years of antibiotics. After taking antibiotics for two years, there is over a 50% chance that that the NTM will return. I started searching for alternative treatments. When I first met with Dr. Elmaleh last November, I was very sick with NTM and severe colitis. I started homeopathic treatments in November. I feel like a different person today. Dr. Elmaleh changed my life"
Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"Dr. Elmaleh has been treating my daughter for several years. While many specialists we worked with were keen to prescribe and send us on our way, Dr. Elmaleh took the time to get to know my daughter and really work with us to get to the root of her allergies. Since we began work with Dr. Elmaleh, we have been able to cut out so many of the drugs prescribed to her by others. Her allergies and asthma have improved and she healthy and happy. Dr. Elmaleh changed our lives, and we are so thankful"
Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"Dr. Elmaleh is a true holistic practitioner. She has her medical training in internal medicine and is also a world-class homeopath.

Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"I have known Dr. E. for 25+ years. I first went to her for my youngest son’s chronic ear infections, which were so bad at age 1 1/2 that he was close to having tubes put. Dr. Elmaleh cured him completely in just a few months. Recently, I consulted her for help with sleep problems; my sleep has gotten a lot better as a result of her treatment. She also figured out why my blood pressure was high and helped me discontinue blood pressure medication. She is a deeply caring and competent doctor."
Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"Dr. Elmaleh is a caring professional, extremely knowledgeable in her field, and just an overall wonderful person. She’s seen us through 2 non-medicated, vaginal childbirths; after-birth physical, mental, and emotional concerns; baby problems like colic and allergies; digestive issues; skin problems; hormonal imbalances; colds and flu (which we never had since having her as our doctor); and a lot more"
Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"After struggling for most of my life with digestive issues, IBS, depression and fatigue, I came to Dr. Elmaleh in 2002. I sought out homeopathy as an alternative and/or compliment to conventional western medicine because I was not getting answers or relief from my symptoms. I’ve been seeing Dr. Elmaleh for 14 years. She evaluates you as a whole person by considering your physical as well as emotional state when prescribing remedies. She is compassionate, caring and dedicated to her patients"

Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"Dr. Elmaleh is extremely knowledgeable in the proper diagnosis and in subscribing the appropriate homeopathic remedies to bring the body into balance. I began seeing Dr. Elmaleh over 18 years ago while suffering from chronic asthma and issues related to menopause such as heart arrhythmias, digestive problems, mood swings etc. Within three months my asthma disappeared completely, digestive issues subsided, and mood swings and nervousness seized. She is a very compassionate and caring person."
Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"My experience with Dr. Elmaleh over the past 30 years has been excellent. I've referred friends, family and my own psychotherapy patients to her."
Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,Dr. Elmaleh is extremely competent and experienced - her sage recommendations have helped me with all kinds of medical issues. She very intensely focuses on every aspect of a patient's health and considers everything about you.

Dr. Rebecca Elmaleh,"She's wonderful. Because of her, I delivered 2 babies on their due dates, without medications/epidurals, and with relatively smooth labors! She's treated everything from rashes, to colds, to anxiety and insomnia. She's a wealth of knowledge both of homeopathy but also of life. Sometimes its like going to a therapist!"
Dr. Katherine Cox,"If I could grade 10 stars, I would. I have never had such a satisfactory visit with a physician. She was courteous, professional, knowledgable, thorough, and most important, she was kind. She listened intently. She explained everything in layman's terms. No medical jargon to confound and confuse. I actually bragged to my family of my find (my doctor is better than your doctor). I don't go to the doctor. I find them dismissive and condescending. Not Dr. Cox. I felt like she genuinely cared"
Dr. Kevin Lin,"An unprofessional doctor who always having a phone call during the appointment. Average spending less than 5 mins with patients, and not giving any advices."

Dr. Teresa Chan,"Dr Chan is my primary care doctor. I absolutely love her. She takes time to listen to your concerns, she is polite and cares about her patients. Very accurate in her opinions and professional. Sometimes it's a little bit hard to reach out to them and the appointment are scheduled sometimes for a month ahead but it's definetely worth the waiting."
Dr. Sandy Fung,"I have been with her for quite a while.....she is patient, understanding, caring, never in a rush, takes the time to explain things to you, very easy to talk to.

He switched my Diabetes medication to Farxiga, from Amaryl, and for the first time in abut 8 years, my blood sugar is the lowest it has ever been. I have lost over 40 lbs. (Farxiga suppresses your appetite), and since I lost so much weight, my BP is now normal, and I am no longer taking the BP meds. Now we are working on lowering the Diabetes Meds even more, by adding Bydureon, then working on my back"
Dr. Noel Smith,This is attempt 3 for me noe. I have been a patient of my friend and Doctor for over 3 years. If your a self fuelling pill popper who crystal like a bit cheaper when he does not get what he wants probably not going to be 2 good fit. If your looking for a loyal Doctor with ACCURATE diagnosis than look no further than Doc Smith. Please don't let the staff sway you from seeing this MN he works hard at his practice and more importantlyrics treats you with dignity ND respect. Hats off to doc.
Dr. Noel Smith,"No other doctor besides Dr. Smith (out of all the doctors I have seen) have been able to put me on the right medication. Thank to Dr. smith, he listens, cares, and has me fully functioning the way I should be"
Dr. Noel Smith,Dr Smith has provided consistently excellent care to my family and others for 15 plus years using high quality traditional/ holistic principles(Integrative medicine). Grandfather developed Temporal Arteritis (inflammation of head arteries) with blindness and physical deterioration on Steroids. Dr Smith detected/corrected the cause saving his vision and life. The strangely critcal previous post on this website is probably a resolvable communication issue with good care as we have gotten.
Dr. Noel Smith,I would not recommend Dr. Smith. I do not think he is a competent doctor. He made mistakes and did not listen
