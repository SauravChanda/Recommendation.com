Great experience was very happy with my results it has been 7 weeks and I am already lifted weight lightly. Was very important to me to go back to my activity.Dr.Silver did what he said put me back together.Was in horrible pain for years if I knew it would be like this I would have had it done years ago.Staff was great . So satisfied I am waiting to do my left .Words can not explain how great he was .Thank you Dr. Silver.,1
Dr Silver operated on my shoulder and my knee. He is patient and caring and takes the time to explain things in plain English. He answered my questions and made me feel comfortable about both procedures. I had rotator cuff surgery on my shoulder and meniscus repair on my knee. My treatment was excellent and I highly recommend him,1
"Dr. Silver did an amazing job arthroscopically shaving off a large sharp hook shaped bone spur and repairing a fully torn rotator cuff, 2 torn muscles and a floating tendon .5 months ago. I had very little pain following surgery and had full range of motion within three months of surgery. I can even zip up a dress by myself! I'm currently working to rebuild strength and endurance, hoping to resume my full exercise routine including push-ups in a few more months.",1
"Dr. Silver is an excellent surgeon who I would highly recommend to those needing knee or shoulder surgery. Unfortunately, his receptionist, Esmyrna is extremely rude. She doesn't return calls and her follow-up is awful. I had to call her numerous times to get her to simply fax a form to my insurance company. She is abrasive and curt and clearly doesn't belong in a healthcare setting. Its unfortunate that such a nice doctor could have such an unpleasant person representing him and his practice",1
"Dr. El-Gazzar is an amazing physician/surgeon. I met him over 4 years ago when I had a broken leg and ankle. 2 years later he performed a partial meniscus replacement on my knee. He is kind, caring, confident and knowledgeable. He has done a knee meniscus replacement on my son and seen my daughter for knee issues. The process for all procedures and after care went smoothly because he took the time to explain everything before and after. I would highly recommend Dr. El-Gazzar.",1
Dr El Gazzar is a very meticulous and caring doctor.... He is very in tune to making his patients understand what your treatment can and will incur.... His staff is very patient friendly.... Don't be intimated to ask questions.,1
was very pleased with the entire experience and would highly recommend Dr. Elgazzar,1
"Dr. Elgazzar is one of the best in the world! He Was in-depth knowledge about my torn PCL. Within ONE day, I had approval from insurance, MRI script faxed to radiologist, and an appointment the NEXT day! I highly recommend Dr. elgazzr you want the best!",1
"Dr El-Gazzar is awesome, he is thoughtful and very caring. He is on point and give options talks to us like we are people. His staff is friendly, very helpful",1
"Dr. El-Gazzar is the finest surgeon I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He took care of my son as a charity patient when he shattered his elbow. We were so lucky to have had him as Jesse's surgeon. He has a reputation for arrogance, but he has earned that right, because he's just that good. I unconditionally recommend him to your attention. I don't even care about the extended wait times to see him at the hospital... we were, after all, a charity case",1
I highly recommend Doctor El-Gazzer to all my friends and families. He is passionate and committed to each patient and makes sure he provides the best possible care.,1
"Great Professional. Very intelligent, and trust worthy. Not part of the big Business field of medicine. Really is concern with my well being and gets me back on track.",1
Best experience!,1

"Dr. Rose is wonderful. I had rotator cuff surgery in 2015 and was amazed how great I felt day one. I heard so many horror stories about the surgery, but not with Dr. Rose, he is the best. I recently injured my knee and went to see Dr. Rose. Appt was easy to get with a pleasant staff member. Went back today for a follow up from my tests, that were just taken yesterday. Again the appt was easy to get and there was no wait, I never even sat, went right in. Talia was great as were all the staff.",1
I would absolutely recommend Dr. Levine to anyone that needs an orthopedic surgeon. I am so happy I decided to get surgery myself and the recovery has brought me back to 100% if not even a little better,1
I would definitely recommend Dr. Levine to family and friends. Thanks for everything!,1
Dr. Levine was a wonderful surgeon and I would highly recommend him,1
"outstanding surgeon ,great pt.care and follow up.",1
Fantastic - Both he and his staff!!!!,1
"Very positive. Good result and generally pleasant interactions, especially during clinic visits. He was a bit curt in responding to some of my queries before the procedure on the day of the surgery (they were logistical, not medical, and had to do with when and where my wife should pick me up after the procedure -- he seemed annoyed by the question yet he was clearly very busy). Otherwise everything has been excellent and I would definitely return to him if I had a similar problem in the future.",1
Very nice Doctor. Very kind and knowledgeable. The best of the best,1
"Dr Albert is the best doctor I've ever encountered he did what he said he was going to do I had two Surgeries cervical spine and also lower spine opening up stenosis, he has the best manners very compassionate and did what he said he was going to do the first time ever a doctor ever did that for me well worth the drive from Connecticut which is a pain in the a-- but would do it again in a heartbeat the best results ever the best doctor ever",1
"Dr. Albert and his staff provide an extremely high level of care. He is the consummate professional in his area of expertise. Not only is he an excellent doctor, he is a very well grounded human being. As a patient, I feel both confident in his surgical abilities and his personal caring approach to my surgical needs.I have recommended him to a number of my friends and coworkers.",1
He saved my right arm after a major automobile accident,1
Fantastic doctor!,1
I would definitely recommend Dr Strauch. He really listened to me and recommended some hand therapy which has me feeling better already! His office was also a pleasure to deal with.,1
Excellent care. He knew exacty what to do. Very successful surgery. Highly recommend,1
"Dr. Seigerman is a knowledgeable and gifted surgeon. He listens to his patient and gives his full attention. He explains things in easily understood terms. He not only is an exceptional doctor, but he is a doctor who truly cares. I highly recommend his services",1
"Great positive experience under Dr Seigermans care. Clearly explained the options to save my finger and insure the best possible use of my finger again. During the operation Dr Seigerman, who has great bedside manner, decided to insert a pin and cast it to insure no movement and a speedy recovery. Dr Seigerman top notch staff shows all the respect, courtesy, support and help through a difficult experience. Thank you for saving my thumb! Highly recommend.",1
"Excellent care, highly recommend Dr. Greisberg.",1
Dr. Greisberg is an excellent orthopedic physician who has truly helped me to recover from my injuries. He is patient and understanding.,1
"Dr. Greisberg was excellent through all stages of the process. He identified all of my options and did not push surgery over non-surgical options. I chose surgery, and he was excellent - I have healed quickly. Dr. Greisberg was spot on in alerting me to how I would feel each day, week, and then each month during my recovery. I strongly recommend him to anybody.",1
"Knowledgeable, caring, and detailed in surgical procedures, assessment, and rehabilitation.",1
Thorough and realistic with my recovery time/process. Excellent surgeon.,1
"He is very professional. He communicates in a gentle. slow easy to understand language and tone. He's very polite and respectful. He listens and resolves my concerns.

"Dr. Greisberg is an excellent knowledgeable surgeon. He operated on the torn tendon in my ankle and the results were great. During the whole surgery and recovery experience, Dr. Greisberg explained to me exactly what I would be experiencing and he was 100% correct. He never rushed me out of his examining room during my office visits. . He explained and listened and now a days that is very rare!! I highly recommend Dr. Greisberg! He's a great doctor and his staff was wonderful too",1
Dr. Gresberg is a great Dr. My foot is feeling much better. It was a long prosee but he did a great job.,1
"I've had two great experiences with Dr. Beldner. He performed surgery to remove a ganglion cyst from my wrist, and recently treated me for tendonitis in the wrist/thumb. Both times he was extremely knowledgeable, professional, and pleasant. He was thorough, took the time to explain to me exactly what the problem was, what he recommended for treatment, and the probability of different possible outcomes regarding my reaction to the treatment. I highly recommend him!",1
"Great Guy! Awesome surgeon! 2 months after tfcc surgery I was back gigging with my band! Can't ask for anything more. Before the surgery, he exhibited patience and care while exhausting all other alternatives before doing the surgery. I wish all Doctors were more like Dr Beldner! His staff is just super.",1
"I would highly recommend Dr. Steven Beldner. Hands down the best doctor I have seen to date! Dr. Beldner and his staff are highly competent, professional, and thorough. I had a broken elbow and I was pretty anxious about my first surgery but they made me feel so comfortable, I never had to guess, and they always follow through. I am forever grateful to Dr. Beldner and his staff. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!",1
Great surgeon!! He once saved this pianist's pinky & let me keep tickling the ivories!!,1
"Great doctor and staff! Professional,sympathetic,thorough. Highly recommend!",1
Dr. Beldner is an excellent hand surgeon. He explains the injury and treatment plans very clearly. He is techically excellent in the operating room. I am a physician and he treated my injury very effectively and got me back to work at full strength. I have full confidence in him and refer all my colleagues and friends with hand and wrist problems to him.,1
"Dr. Beldner is great--he's kind, gentle and explains things in an accessible way. He's clearly and expert and I immediately trusted him to make the best decisions for my care. I'd recommend him without reservations to anyone.",1
Great Dr. Easy to talk to. Listens well to your problems.,1
Dr Bland is very caring and explains things well. He is easy to talk to.,1
I really enjoy going to his office - everyone is really friendly,1
I would recommend Dr. Bland to others! A friend recommended Dr. Bland to me!,1
Dr. Bland act in a very professional manner and I have been satisfied with every visit I've had with him.,1
I have seen Dr. Bland since I was a baby. I have always had a positive experience with him.,1
Future and current patients beware. Dr. Gomoll performed a partial knee replacement on me. Had to have a full knee replacement after 17 month. The surgeon who performed my total knee stated the device was malaligned and he could see mechancial catching of my patella on the device Dr. Gomoll installed. Been in recovery for over three years.,1
"I have been a patient of Dr. Gomoll for over 10 years and the only negative thing I have to say is that he is leaving MA to move to NY. He is a Doctor unlike any other I have had the chance to meet. Over the years I have spent countless hours talking about my knee with Dr. G and I don't have a bad thing to say. He is patient and kind, not to mention talented. He both takes the time to listen and explain things. I am sad to see him leave and NY is very lucky to have him.",1
14 months ago my daughter had surgery for a frayed miniscus. During the initial surgery her first surgeon found significantly more damage and had the foresight to stop and refer us to Dr. G. He met with us and suggested a course to allow my daughter to continue her athletics. He was positive and thorough. A year later she worked hard and has recovered well resuming all her activities. I highly recommend Dr. Gomoll,1
"Dr. Gomoll is a true professional in every sense of the word. I call him my ""miracle doctor"" as he was able to find a spot for me in a trial study for my knee. Just amazing and I'm thankful to be under his care.",1
"I can't say enough about this doctor. My daughter is 15 years old. She has had a rare condition called Osteochondritis Dissecans since she was approximately 8 years old. Over the years, she has gotten 3 lesions that needed treatment as she doesn't respond to conservative treatment. She had her most major surgery last July with Dr Gomoll. He did an osteochondral allograft, MPFL repair, and TTO. I cannot say enough about his care and technique. This has worked! My daughter has no pain now",1
"Rare combination of kind and competent. Listens well and takes the whole person into consideration when deciding on best course of action. Big believer in doing no harm and will exhaust other treatment options before surgery, this is a good thing! If surgery is necessary he is well versed in best practices, especially for biologic joint reconstruction. Cartilage procedures are his forte and he's keeping me active at 40 when other doctors would have just given up on my knee.",1
"Cannot say enough great things about Dr. Gomoll and his practice. Never had issues with appointments, visits, surgeries, follow-ups, etc. As a doctor I felt he was very personable and actually seemed genuinely concerned about me as a patient.",1
"My experience with Dr Gomoll has been extremely positive. He takes the time to clearly explain his diagnosis and discusses options objectively. I never felt rushed or ""just another patient"". After years of knee pain and countless time spent doing PT and receiving cortisone shots; I am pain free. My daily activity has increased and I am looking forward to exercising again",1
This physician refuses to speak to physicians when they want to refer patients. His staff gives you the run around and lies and says that they will have the doctor call their primary care doctor when he has no interest in doing so. He obviously only cares about the money and not patients.,1
Dr Gomoll put my knee back together almost 8 years ago. Without that procedure I certainly be contemplating a knee replacement. He seems to handle the worst of the worst. His OA Courtney is always very helpful. A very skilled surgeon.,1
"Dr. Gomoll took a conservative approach to treating a torn meniscus. Ultimately, I needed to have a surgical procedure to address a meniscal tear; I am very please with the results. There was a lot of helpful communication and explanation from Dr. Gomoll and his staff before, during and after the procedure. Every question I had was thoughtfully and thoroughly answered.",1
"very professional staff all around, really care about the patient's well-being, overall great experience",1
"Dr Gomoll performed ACI surgery on me in December 2014. The surgery went well and I have since returned to all of my activities. He followed up and was always friendly and professional. While I hope to not need another knee surgery, I would go back to Dr Gomoll, particularly if I need ACI on the other knee at some point",1
He did a great job of explaining my options. The Conformis partial knee replacement surgery has gone well so far. Three weeks after surgery I have accomplished 120 degree range of bend. This is following the recommended PT exercise regimen. He called me the day after the surgery to see how I was doing. My home health team were highly impressed with the outcome with the Conformis knee and wound healing. I would recommend him wholeheartedly. Brigham Womens Faulkner Hospital rocks.,1
"Dr Gomoll did a high-tibial osteotomy to relieve my severe knee pain. It's a surgery, I later found out, that most orthopedic surgeons today don't even know how to do. That surgery solved my problem and made it unnecessary to get a knee replacement. Dr Gomoll puts the patient first, he is not out to ""sell"" surgeries, he explains everything in plain English, and he's always upbeat and personable. He's the best!",1
Dr.Stephen g. Silver performed surgery on my rotator cuff and saved my arm and shoulder. He did an excellent job and his staff and surgery associates were all wonderful. excellent surgeon.I would Highly recommend him to my family and friends!,1

I'm currently working to rebuild strength and endurance, hoping to resume my full exercise routine including push-ups in a few more months.",1
"Saw Dr. Silver for diagnosis of multiple shoulder issues. He suspected a labrum tear from my symptom and I received an MRI that confirmed it. Surgery booked within a month and 7 months later am thrilled with results. Wonderful surgeon with a great demeanor. Love Vivian, his office manager as well.",1
"I highly recommend Dr. Silver for any patient with an AC Joint separation requiring surgery. Dr. Silver and his staff are professional, they make you comfortable, and they take pride in their work. If your healthcare coverage gives you the option, I strongly recommend going to the Vanguard Surgical Center in NJ where Dr. Silver operates. Their facility is state of the art and his surgery team was remarkable! Dr. Silver is the best in the business!",1
"I tore the tendon in my shoulder a year ago and I was told by two Doctors that there is nothing they can do. I found Dr. Silver and he was able to make the repair which changed my life since I am an active individual. The day after the surgery, Dr. Silver called me to see how I was doing and gave me some recommendations on what I should be doing. Dr. Silver = Dr. Good News !! He also has an amazing staff that will ensure a smooth process",1
"I had a knee scope performed by Dr. Silver on 12/14/16 to remove meniscus tear. The procedure was quick, it was performed at a great surgical center in NJ, Vanguard. It has been less than 24 hours and I already removed the bandage. I have very little swelling and almost no pain in the knee. Dr. Silver and the staff at his facility were amazing!! I hope not to have any more knee surgeries, but if I need one, I will most definitely go back to Dr. Silver. Thank you sir for taking great care of me!!",1
"I have had to have two surgeries over the past year,on my right biceps tendon (ruptured at the elbow) and my left rotator cuff (torn). Both surgeries were completely successful from my point of view. Right arm is fine and my left arm can reach over my head ,which may not sound like much, but from not being able to lift it all-it represents a steady climb to full mobility (surgery was 4 months ago). Dr. Silver is professional and I would recommend him to any of my family or friends.",1
"I can't say enough great things about Dr Silver, his staff, the office, and everyone involved! Dr. Silver establishes rapport easily and made me feel comfortable and in great hands from my initial appointment! His office staff was amazing as far as handling scheduling of surgery and acquiring test results. My surgery was flawless and my recovery went great! One of my best medical decisions was to be placed in his care!",1
"I have lived with shoulder pain for 15 years. And then I met Dr. Stephen G. Silver and scheduled surgery. My bicep tendon was shredded, had significant bone spurs, multi tears, arthritis etc. Amazingly I had zero pain following the surgery. The recovery has been relatively easy. I credit Dr. Silver for his meticulous work. He’s also warm, inviting and shows he cares. He is a master at his craft. I couldn’t recommend him and Vanguard Surgical Center more enthusiastically.",1
"Dr. Silver is an excellent surgeon who I would highly recommend to those needing knee or shoulder surgery. Unfortunately, his receptionist, Esmyrna is extremely rude. She doesn't return calls and her follow-up is awful. I had to call her numerous times to get her to simply fax a form to my insurance company.

"I've been to many doctors over past years and I can safely say that this is the first time I was compelled to write a review. The doctor himself is very busy but he takes the time to explain everything until you feel comfortable with your diagnosis. Also Dr Elgazzar is NOT ""let's rush surgery"", surgery was the last resort after we tried all other options. The office is very modern and clean and the staff were pleasant and professional. I recommend him highly.",1

He was very patient and sat with me to discuss what was wrong. Great quality of care and hospitality.,1
"Please do yourself a favor never go and see Dr El-Gazzar. I was made to wait 120 minutes before his assistant come and took a stock at my problem. 6 mins that's what he took to document my years old problem. Then comes Dr El-Gazzar, a self proclaimed super busy guy, not in mood to understand patient needs and problem. He spent 2 mins, yeah that's right 2 MINS, and went away. Then comes his assistant back again and gave me prescription and left the room. That's it the appointment was over.",1
Dr. El Gazzar is a wonderful dr. He us caring and his staff is wbderful. His wife Samia is hust as caring and takes time to talk and comfort pstients. I highly recommend this dr. Bernadette Berry,1

And, I haven’t even finished PT yet. I feel brand new again. A few years ago, I had a TKR with amazing results as well. Both times thanks to Dr. Rose. Aside from being a gifted orthopedic surgeon with the skill of a plastic surgeon. He is kind and caring. He gets the job done and done well!",1
"I was satisfied with Dr. Howard Rose, but as far as his staff and especially the billing department they are the worst I ever dealt with in any medical office. I went to see Dr. Rose for a knee injury, I saw him twice in 2 weeks. After about another 2 weeks, I got a call from the billing department telling me that they received a call from workers comp insurance company stating that my injury was now under review with workers comp and that Dr. Rose does not handle Worker comp insurance so I need",1
"have used Dr. Rose for all my orthopedic needs for many year. In my opinion, he is amazing. I have also referred several family members and friends who have had knee replacements performed by Dr. Rose, all with success.",1
Dr Rose is ok. Nothing special. He did my total knee replacement 9 months ago. Been giving me problems the last 2. His office was not courteous all the time. Go somewhere else. You can do better.,1
"Dr Rose is a good surgeon but his staff is so bad that I can't recommend him. They are unprofessional, rude, mean, insensitive. They are bullies. His nurse practitioner is a the most unhappy, nasty, disrespectful witch I have come across in a medical setting. I have said all of this to the doctor. I very strongly think he will do nothing about it. I am sure he already knows.",1
"LI Office-Dr. Rose, talented & exceptionally gifted orthopedic surgeon; suggest he take a closer look at his office staff. Waiting for my mother provided several chances to observe how people are treated in the waiting room. First, look up & acknowledge when a patient is standing in front of you to check in; eye-contact would even be acceptable?. Staff is the first introduction to your office; should minimally be professionally & courteous. Observed too many times to be just an odd occurance.",1
"He was a good and caring doctor.",1
