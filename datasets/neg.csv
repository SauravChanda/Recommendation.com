"Her hours are not convenient at all, but her treatment was good!",0
"I was not at all happy with Dr Starkman ... To start the staff is rude and appear bothered when you arrive... After sitting in the waiting area for approximately two (2) HOURS; Dr. Starkman arrives disheveled with a look of confusion... When i start my consultation i did not feel as if his attention was solely on me.. He looked at his cell phone a couple of times, he accepted a call and i had to reminded him what we were discussing... I truly would not recommend this doctor",0
Dr Kister and his office failed me miserably. He misdiagnosed me with multiple sclerosis in 2011. He refused to do a spinal tap but had no problem treating me with toxic medication. I then begged for a spinal tap. I contacted his office even the office social worker and got no response at all. I then received a package from the office with all my records. I do not have multiple sclerosis. I have chronic Lyme's disease. I found out because I doctor did a spinal tap on me and tested me,0
I felt rushed. She is not a good listener. I think she can be a bit warmer and more accommodating with her patients,0
"My first appointment was scheduled when the dr was at a conference and not in the office to see me. I was not told until I was at the appt. After 4 appts, I was unhappy with the side effects of the medication prescribed and asked to be taken off the medication. The dr. filled a reduced rx and never called me or found time to see me to discuss a revised treatment plan or explain how I might feel being off the medication. horrible bedside manner. Will be finding a new neuro",0
Caring gentle professional and an expert. Always calls back. Thanks,0
"I made an appointment, and was running late from work. I tried to call to ask if I can come in late or reschedule, but my phone call didn’t go through due to poor service on the train. They denied me an appointment ever again. What kind of doctor denies a patient in need of care",0
Scheduling an appointment was horrible and confusing and the office wait for the appointment was terrible. It took 2 hours of waiting for a schedule appointment. Its a shame because he seems like a good doctor,0
"Dr. Barone was very flippant, arrogant, unprofessional and unhelpful. Didn’t return phone calls or emails. I wouldn’t recommend going to him",0
I'm very disappointed with the way I was treated at Dr. Briskin's office. It was hard to get in touch with a doctor over the phone when I need it and more care about receiving the copay then treating a patient. She wasn't ready with all the paperwork at the time of my appointment which started 30 min later then it was scheduled. At the time of my appointment I was informed about broken office equipment and proposed to come on different day. Would not recommend this doctor to my family or friend,0
"Dr. Weinberg is a bad doctor! I have had 2 cancers, 8 surgeries, and am quite astute when it comes to the medical arena. This MD was excessively sarcastic and condescending. He called for a C-spine MRi and told me to call for the results. When I reached him, he offered nothing but ""you have a bad back ... lots of problems."" When I tried to get him to engage in some detail as to what was found on the MRI, he would not. A waste of time. I advise going elsewhere. I learned nothing, gained nothing",0
"I find it hard to believe that any of the positive reviews are true. This doctor is rude, and his level of knowledge is less than any other medical professional I have had. I would never recommend him and if you are using him I highly recommend trying someone else. He runs his office like a failing business desperate to grab every dollar he can. He does not have a bedside manner unless you liked to be talked down to about your own body and health. He is a terrible doctor",0
"Not only he rushes you but doesn't listen to all your symptoms. Clearly just wants the money,thats it.The front desk girl so rude, my god, wouldn't answer, put me twice on hold and when she picked up the 3rd time she hung up. Pointless worker clearly. NEVER AGAIN",0
I would not recommend this doctor to ANYONE. She is cold and does not have the people skills required to form a relationship between a patient and a doctor. She does not follow up on what she says she will do either. She also does not properly explain things to a patient in a way that they can understand and are satisfied,0
"The worst. Rude. Obnoxious. Workmanlike. I feel sorry for anyone in Leifer's care. He simply does not give a blank about his patients. Either Leifer is plodding away while keeping patients waiting, eating while keeping patients waiting, on the phone while keeping patients waiting or seeing patients with an attitude like it's the last thing he wants to be doing. An educated jerk",0
"Perhaps one of the worst physicians I have ever dealt with. He is almost ambivalent when it comes trying to address my husband's medical condition, he has no suggestions or a treatment plan to try to make forward progress. To make matters even worse you have to wait over an hour for every appointment and trying to get him to refill your prescriptions is near impossible without 3 to 4 phone calls/messages",0
"“0” Stars. Does the office staff reflect the physician? I had my first visit to Dr. Schottenstein on 4/4. 1 of the 2 presrcriptions needed Dr. preorthorization. I left a message for 3 consecutive days. None was returned. Traveled from Staten lsland to Lenox Hill Radiology 4/10 in Bay Ridge for scheduled MRI & X-ray . Told to be there 9:45. Left home 9AM. Received call LHR at home 9:20. Message...”doctor never authorized tests; called office, no one answered (surprise!).Reschedule.” Unbelievable",0
"Horrible human and doctor. I had an appointment. Waited over an hour then was put in a room. After another 45 minutes spoke with a PS who took my information. He came back 5 minutes later and said, sorry, he can't prescribe the medication you are on. I asked if I could see the doctor. After waiting again, more time passed and was told to go to someone else and gave me the name of a clinic that couldn't help",0
The Dr has terrible [nonexistent] bedside manners. Always late. Considering her mediocre training & pedigree she sure has a lot of attitude. Her staff is rude/ incompetent. They've flubbed every appt i've had on the scheduling side & then they give u major attitude in person. Highly avoidable,0
terrible office staff and medical assistants unable to get through on the phone outside normal business hours took over 5 days to get my test results will not return i am considering taking legal action against this practice for their gross incompetency,0
Bad bad experience with her staff,0
"I do not recommend Dr. Nagy. She was recommended by a good friend who delivered her baby, so I was really expecting a great experience. Just SOME of the issues:  -Can never get a hold of her when I call, always referred to a nurse -Prescribed me medication without waiting for all the results to be back (turned out I didn't need the medication) -Wound up in ER (e-mailed her while there to inform her), told me to get better. Did not tell me to come see her or check on me I have switched Drs",0
"I'd NEVER recommend Dr. Mehta to anyone, especially 1st time moms. She's careless, not patient-friendly, does not follow-up with her patients and is simply unreliable. I am a 1st time mom who's had a rough start w/a well-planned pregnancy. After my 1st prenatal visit where she DID NOTHING but fill my head w/doubts & unnecessary worries, she promised to call me and discuss test result the next day. 3 days went by and I had to ask clinic to have a diff. Dr. read the results. Again, NOT reliable!",0
"The worst experience ever, the man never took a word I said seriously, he is that bad I never went back for my Checkup after my c section, and of course never got a phone call to remind me to come back, shows all they cared. The day of my c section in walked into the room and never even said hello to me, my husband was disgusted, Please restore your terrible",0
Never. The worst doctor I have ever seen. Messed up my rxns multiple times and never took a single concern seriously. DO NOT go to him. The only good part is that his staff is nice.,0
"THE.WORST. I can't even begin to describe how rude and unprofessional this weasel of a man is. Went in for an ultrasound and simply got the worst treatment ever. I left the office crying. Cold, cold, as were his staff. I will never step foot there again. RUN AWAY",0
RUDE DOCTOR! PLEASE AVOID! RUN AWAY! WORSE DOCTOR EVER!,0
"I can't recommend Dr. Pothuri highly enough. My obgyn referred me to her after a concerning MRI for uterine cancer risk. Dr. Pothuri took the time to carefully make and execute a game plan, communicated it with me clearly and listened to all my input throughout the process. Her entire hospital team was first class and the entire hospital experience/surgical procedure could not have gone more smoothly. I had full confidence in her expertise and would highly recommend her to anyone in need of a su",0
She needs an attitude adjustment. I am going to switch doctors. She's unprofessional and talks to everyone around her in a condescending manner. She's also very unorganized. If she could communicate better maybe things would run more smoother with her patients,0
"If i could leave 0 Stars i would... My surgery was LAST AUGUST (2017) robotic assisted endometriosis removal. Dr. Levey knew I had a UTI from my pre-op appointment & never prescribed medicine. He told me while I was being prepped to go under, saying that the medicine would be ready immediately for pick up afterwards. He then operated on me WITH AN INFECTION. While in recovery, he left the hospital without signing discharge papers. The hospital staff was beyond angry claiming that he never",0
"he did NOT do any thing in my surgery, he just a greedy doctor. His invoice is so expensive and nothing was done by him, I had one surgery after him they found every thing as described in his MRI.",0
"Arrogant, awful, money-grubbing doctor. If you want to read real reviews--and not the ones his staff makes up--visit Yelp",0
"Horrible to understand, didn't even have my file at hand during my appt. I was there for results and answers about a procedure needed to be done, but he comes and he asked my daughter and me what was wrong? when asked about my file, he said he had so many patients he didn't get a chance to get my file, yet I am sitting there and he never asked one of the assistants to get it. It was like he was trying to brush us off. I DO NOT TRUST HIM or recommend",0
Not very attentive doesn't explain things in a way you can understand. Doesn't spent much time with patient.... I will not recommend him to any one.,0
"DO NOT VISIT THE DOCTOR. Waiting time is over two hours. I went with my wife and the staff made me wait for two hours and later came to tell me that the doctor will bill full amount to me and not willing to take the insurance Co-pay. The doctor office do not want to deal with the insurance. The same thing could have been told as soon as i visited the office or over the phone. Very unprofessional staff. BE AWARE, HE IS EXPENSIVE AND WILL WASTE TIME.",0

I would not recommend Dr. Smith. I do not think he is a competent doctor. He made mistakes and did not listen.,0
"No professionalism , misdiagnosed my condition. Maybe he should switch careers",0
This physician refuses to speak to physicians when they want to refer patients. His staff gives you the run around and lies and says that they will have the doctor call their primary care doctor when he has no interest in doing so. He obviously only cares about the money and not patients.,0
"Please do yourself a favor never go and see Dr El-Gazzar. I was made to wait 120 minutes before his assistant come and took a stock at my problem. 6 mins that's what he took to document my years old problem. Then comes Dr El-Gazzar, a self proclaimed super busy guy, not in mood to understand patient needs and problem. He spent 2 mins, yeah that's right 2 MINS, and went away. Then comes his assistant back again and gave me prescription and left the room. That's it the appointment was over.",0
"DO NOT book an appointment with Dr. Rose. His medical skills are great, but his office staff (his family members) mistreat and denigrate their patients, make frequent mistakes, no customer service, dont return phone calls or emails, lie and may attack you. This happened to both me and my mom after being patients there for four years. This is absolutely the most incompetent and unprofessional practice I have ever experienced. I do not recommend him to anyone, seek competent care elsewhe",0
Dr. Polatsch is not the best hand doctor/surgeon. He is the BEST of the best! Period. I had "trigger finger" symptoms and went to one of the best NYU Langone hand doctors whom I visited twice but my fingers continue to worsen. I decided to visit Dr. Polatsch and he did exactly the same procedure (injections) as the doctor at NYU Langone but slightly differently in terms of which spots of the fingers were injected. I took note of that and the difference with the NYU Langone treatment,0
"Staff, in particular PA and officer manager were rude",0
"This doctor is very unprofessional and mean in his patient relation. He disrespected, humiliated and dehumanized me all because of his staff incompetence and inability to their job at a timely manner that resulted in NYU cancelling my surgery booking. I have requested his office to schedule a pre- surgical appointment with NYU physician under my Workman's case, as I couldn't get it done with my PC. Next, Dr Steiber threw my case out, declined my numerous request for an appt to talk him.",0
Still suffering,0
"I would NOT recommend seeing Dr. Rosenwasser. He is obviously well qualified and an intelligent person, however his lack of care, respect, and attention are what make him a horrible doctor. If you want someone who will be attentive to your case and will provide solutions, he is NOT the doctor for you. He treated me like absolute garbage and gave me no time of day (treated me like I was a bother). Faculty is rude and had multiple forms incorrectly process on their end.",0

"This doctor is more concerned about ""consensus"" with other doctors than helping patients.

I dont recomend going to them for anything. First off my husband had to go for a double fracture and I had to reminded them of the second fracture because they only looked at one. They do not take the slightest bit of time to talk to or care for the patients. We have gotten litteraly maybe a minute of time with the doctor each visit and is always very short with us. Secound the paperwork he needed done for work has not been filled out. They have been faxed the forums twice now and have failed to fill them out and return them. The short term disability office will also will not answer any calls. This has got to be the worst office I have ever been to.,0

"I went to this place because I had a pinched nerve in my left elbow. I took therapy and wore a brace while sleeping so I didn't bend my arm so much during the night. Finally it was suggested that I have surgery. I did the surgery which was a VERY PAINFUL SURGERY! I was in a lot of bad bad pain afterwards. I was given vicodin for pain for several months. But, now half of my palm and outer wrist is asleep! It is so much worse than before surgery. I believe it wasn't Dr. Cook that did the surgery like I was told. I believe Julie Weller CNP did my surgery. She was the one in the operating room and I NEVER even seen thisDR. COOK and if I did he must of poked his head in the room and left. I couldn't even say there is a DR. COOK for sure! I think she did my surgery and she IS NOT a surgeon and messed me up really really bad. Then when I complained they sent me back to the same person that did my pre- op test. So, of course he wouldn't say it was worse! I should of went somewhere else for a POST-OP opinion. I can't sue because they said I signed a paper saying I couldn't if something went wrong. This was the worse operation I have ever experienced in my life and I'm 59 yrs old and I have had many surgeries. So, now I just live with a half asleep left hand and deal with dropping things all the time and having very little strength. It's hard to even clip my fingernails like they left me. I wouldn't advise ANYONE to go to this place and if you do, GOOD LUCK!!!! Thank you,",0
